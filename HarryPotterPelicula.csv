Great fun!,TheLittleSongbird,"I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",21 April 2009,8,21,

Good Start to the Series,Michael_Elliott,,5 March 2016,0,,
Great chemistry set up for the rest of the series,SnoopyStyle,"Harry Potter is an orphan living with his ignorant uncle and aunt under their stairs. He finds out that he is actually a wizard and there is a secret world out there.
This is the first of a series, and it introduces the franchise very well. Some of the style is still a little rough. The CGI isn't top notch, and the sets have some work to do. But those are minor drawbacks in an otherwise superb film.
The best part of it must be the great chemistry between the three young leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint). That is objective number one. With that accomplished, the rest is just icing on the cake. Director Christopher Columbus must be commended for weaving a coherent and compelling story while setting the groundwork for the rest of the franchise. It is tough work, and could easily flounder in less experienced hands.",21 December 2013,8,3,
Charming and Endearing!,Hitchcoc,"How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with ""Hamburger: The Movie."" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a ""kids"" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a ""book."" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies.
We are introduced to the Harry Potter canon as he becomes a foundling, taken into a family that mistreats him and has no respect for his general goodness. Of course, they pay a price for their insensitivity and Harry takes the magical journey to enroll at Hogwarts. It is obvious that his coming has great import for everyone. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they begin a quest to locate the Sorcerer's Stone. We find out about Voldemort and the curse that hangs over Hogwarts, going back centuries. We are also introduced to Quiddich which will be a staple for all episodes. Harry also must struggle with what happened to his parents and, like Frodo in ""Lord of the Rings,"" his quest and what it means. Outstanding film.",28 November 2001,9,,

Part 1,kosmasp,"If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o)
But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't).

Where it all began.,lee_eisenberg,"With the sixth book now out (and one more to go), I feel that I should review ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". By now, the Harry Potter books have become so well entrenched in our culture that I don't even need to explain the story. But I can say that director Chris Columbus did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen.
The cast does very well with the roles: newcomer Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, making him strong-willed but vulnerable. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play his friends, the uptight Ron Weasley and the no-nonsense Hermione Granger. The Hogwarts staff is played by a who's-who of British actors: Richard Harris as headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as anthropomorphic Prof. Minerva McGonagall (and one can detect a hint of Miss Jean Brodie there), Alan Rickman as unctuous Prof. Severus Snape, and Robbie Coltrane as gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid. Others include Zoe Wanamaker as Quidditch teacher Madame Hooch, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (Ron's mum), Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley (Harry's mean uncle) and even John Cleese as Nearly-Headless-Nick, one of the school ghosts.
All in all, this is a movie for the ages. I know that religious fundamentalists will claim that the Harry Potter books are promoting witchcraft, but are we really going to believe those kinds of people, considering that they claimed the same things about ""Bewitched""? Harry Potter will live forever - something that no Muggle can do.",5 October 2005,10,,
Off to a Successful Start,gavin6942,"Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
This is the film that started it all, and was, of course, a huge success. One might wonder what would happen if you had seven movies to make and the first one already flopped or was poorly done. But this did not happen. The crew was perfect, with a master of family films (Chris Columbus) at the helm. The casting could have been tricky, since they had to get children to act well on screen and then make sure they could keep them for a decade. Daniel Radcliffe proved to be perfect for the part, and Emma Watson does alright, too, despite overacting at times.
The adult cast is fleshed out with plenty of solid choices, filling the void from serious, to silly to scary. Alan Rickman, who plays Snape, has a little bit of all three, and was really a crucial casting choice, and the costume department did their best to make him look like Trent Reznor. Perhaps they could have cast Reznor himself, but I suspect he does not have Rickman's range.
Of all the films in the series, this is the lightest. There is a villain, but he plays a minor role. And there are some dangerous challenges, but overall the element of fun remains. These are 11-year old children, so there needs be no rush to push them into a world of life and death. And for those who have not read the books, this is our first time meeting everyone, so introductions and character development are important.",02-May-11,7,,

A Surprise,ccthemovieman-1,"This first Harry Potter surprised me. Not a reader of the books nor a proponent of occult beliefs, I still went into this with an open mind and found I enjoyed the movie. I watched the first three films and own the third (""Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban"").
This film offered good escapist fare with lots of interesting sets and special- effects, as all the films have done. There is very good color and sound in here, making it even more attractive with a good TV and sound system.
Daniel Radcliff was a likable hero, with his round glasses and winsome smile. You can't help but root for him. His friends, played by Rupert Gint and Emma Watson, are okay but Watson gets annoying as the know-it-all school girl. She became more likable in the subsequent Potter films. For me, the British accents in here were not always easy to understand.
The story, despite its length of two-and-a-half hours, movies pretty well as there is always something interesting to view. Once again, this movie and the sequels all excelled in this department with great visuals.",1 October 2006,8,,

Harry goes his destiny at Hogwart's school , there meets our friends Ron(Rupert Grint) ,Hermione(Emma Watson) and his enemies Braco Malfoy(Tom Felton), along the dark forces which threatens Hogwart, and finally Lord Voldemor .

Here some legendary events take place , including a Quiddich match, and Harry Potter competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters as unicorn, centaur and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle .
This episode contains loads of adventures and action and is such deeply riveting and emotional as its followings , furthermore gets lots of bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures, a breathtaking ogre ,a three-head animal , and Potter fighting creepy , scary monsters and an exciting final taking on between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen . The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry, witchcraft, horror, humor and is extremely amusing and pretty enjoyable. Darkest even that subsequent chapters is thrilling, dramatic, touching and very exciting. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out . In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J. K. Rowling. The motion picture is splendidly filmed with sensational production design and colorful cinematography by John Seale . Phenomenal and spectacular music by master John Williams. The movie is magnificently directed by Chris Colombus . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels.

Overrated but entertaining,Quinoa1984,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment. It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects. It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department. But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.
A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams). Yet it is not a great film. Grade: between A- and B+",19 November 2001,7,,
We're Off to See the Wizard,wes-connors,"""Harry Potter learns, on his 11th birthday, that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards, and possesses magical powers of his own. (Sent to) 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', Harry embarks on the adventure of a lifetime, discovering a world of magic and fantasy, where he is destined to live,"" according to the film's official synopsis. This was the first of the films bringing J.K. Rowling's beloved ""Harry Potter"" characters to motion picture life; and, it must be considered a rousing success.
Importantly, Ms. Rowling insisted on retaining much creative control, so a higher than usual amount of integrity to the material is maintained. This doesn't benefit the film in every respect; but, it certainly was, in hindsight, the only sure-fire way to introduce these adventures to cinema. One change, done for the book, was that the title would be altered from ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for U.S. consumption; it goes against the grain, and works perfectly. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is shorter, provides alliteration, and better illustrates the conflict present in the story.
Initially, it wasn't obvious that the young trio playing ""Harry"", ""Ron"", and ""Hermione"" had the acting ability to go along with looking right for the leading roles; fortunately, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson would turn out to be just perfect. Richard Harris (as Albus Dumbledore) and Maggie Smith (as Minerva McGonagall) herald a stellar parade of Brits playing throughout the ""Potter"" films, with Robbie Coltrane (as Rubeus Hagrid) going to the head of this, the first class.

The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders.
The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer.

"Ahh, the magic begins.",hitchcockthelegend,"Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.
Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.
Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.
The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.

Bloody Brilliant ? Bloody Crap More Like,Theo Robertson,"I don`t rate JK Rowling as a writer so when the hype machine stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE ( As it`s called in Britain ) was going to be faithful to the book I thought this was a film that wasn`t worth seeing but I decided to give it a chance , after all I hadn`t expected much from THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING but I ended up falling in love with Peter Jackson`s beautiful masterpiece . But after watching THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE my instincts had been proved right and in many ways the film had lived down to expectations .
First of all I found it highly patronizing the way it talks down to its audience in a very substandard Roald Dahl way . Secondly the film has far too many characters that add nothing to the plot , and thirdly I`m not sure if the film actually has a plot . Yeah things happen but many of these things don`t seem to lead to anything so why were they included ?
I noticed the second Harry Potter film didn`t perform as well as hoped which gives me hope that the next films in the franchise bomb big time . And I reckon Frodo Baggins could kick Harry Potter`s ass",10 June 2003,1,,

Harry Potter is a bore!,jotix100,"I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film, but I thought it was plain boring. The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average. Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle. The effects are very well done, but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over. It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all. This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments.
I was greatly disappointed given the hype in the media, which I'm sure has Ms. Rowling, Mr. Columbus and the rest of the people responsible for this mess laughing all the way to the bank!",28 November 2001,4,9,

REVIEWED IN 2020...SINGULARLY...APART FROM THE BOOK AND THE SEQUELS,LeonLouisRicci,"The Debut Movie that Flag-Shipped the Film-Series, that became a Phenom in Itself.
It was Hardly a Chance-Effort.
The Popular Books by Rowland had a Built-In Audience Salivating at the Prospect.
CGI had Evolved into a ""We Can Do Anything"" in SFX for the Asking and the Budget was Magical to say the Least.
Top-Notch Acting Talent Among the Adults, Coupled with Energetic and Charming Tweens Added the Finishing Touches on a Guaranteed Block-Buster.
Most Fans Reacted, Admitting it is Slavishly Faithful to the Books and the Scope of the Story is Made for an Audience from 6 to 60,
By most Accounts the Initial Movie was a Bona-Fide Success, Artistically and Commercially.
Outsiders, Newbies, and the Uniformed also seem to Warm Up to the Charming and sometimes Edgy Youth Material.
There were Rumblings from Evangelicals about ""Satan Worship"", Witchcraft Corrupting the Minds of the Impressionable.
But that is Expected and an Argument as Old as the Printed Word.
Kids Love it and most Adults went along for the Magical, Fantastic Ride that was On-Screen Fresh in 2001 and quite the Treat for Movie-Goers.
It's about as Inoffensive as this Type of Thing could be, and maybe went Too Far with its ""Play it Safe"" Attitude.
The Movie Leans Away from the Cutting-Edge and can be a bit Dull for those Expecting more Horrifying Elements.
It's a Wonderful Movie for the Whole Family and when its Initial Release Date Finally Arrived,
Everybody seemed to get in On the Fun.

"Long, but pretty good",preppy-3,"Adaptation of J.K. Rowling's very popular book is as good an adaptation as possible...but it doesn't completely work.
The big problem was they were afraid to cut anything out of the book (they'd have school children all around the world after them), so they try to put everything in and there's too much for one movie. Also it's a virtual word-by-word recitation of the book--if you've read the book, you've seen the movie. This doesn't allow director Chris Columbus any leeway to change things or add his own personal stamp (not that Columbus was ever an inventive director to begin with). So, it just ends up being the book visualized exactly as written.
The acting is so-so. The kids picked to play Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are pretty good--not great, but certainly not bad. The adults vary wildly--Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker (love her yellow eyes!) are just great as teachers at Hogwats...Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are horrible...they're REALLY not enjoying themselves. Also John Williams bombastic score is annoying.
Still, it looks great, moves fairly quickly and there's a fantastic sequence showing a Quidditch game. So, it's OK but nothing great. Maybe if Spielberg had directed it...",6 December 2001,7,,
What I say doesn't matter,dbborroughs,"I'm not a fan of the books. The ones I read seem like Roald Dahl wannabes. To me the books were young adult fiction that seems like young adult fiction.

I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel.

"It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.",lastliberal,"I went back to look at the two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies. These were the one that were more light fantasy and enjoyable in that light.
Mr. Ollivander: Curious... very curious... Harry: Excuse me, sir, but what's curious? Mr. Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix whose tailfeather resides in your wand gave another... just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... when its brother gave you that scar. Harry: And who owned that wand? Mr. Ollivander: We do not speak his name! The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible!

We see the spectacular art and set decorations, particularly in the Great hall by Stuart Craig (art director) and Stephanie McMillan (set decorator). Costune design by Judianna Makovsky and music by John Williams makes this a film to remember. The special effects were fantastic.

When Being Too Faithful to Source Material Is a Bad Thing,evanston_dad,"I read enough of the first ""Harry Potter"" book to know that Chris Columbus virtually recreated it scene by scene. However, I also read enough to know that what he put on screen was a plodding, overly literal adaptation that doesn't have an ounce of magic or creativity in it.
To be fair to Columbus, I don't really know what the alternative was. The fan base for ""Harry Potter"" wanted the experience of watching it to match exactly the experience of reading it, and would have revolted at any more daring cinematic vision. It always makes me wonder why people want to watch movies based on their favorite books in the first place -- just read the books instead.

A Fantasy Film Suitable for the Entire Family,Uriah43,"Orphaned not long after his birth, ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) is forced to live in the home of his only living relatives who treat him rather badly. That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named ""Rebeus Hagrid"" (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named ""Ron Weasley"" (Rupert Grint) and ""Hermione Granger"" (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes). Even so, despite the faults just mentioned, I believe this to be one of those rare movies which can be enjoyed by the entire family and I have rated it accordingly.

There's nothing like the first,HotToastyRag,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.
Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!
Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?
First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",17 June 2019,10,,

"For the most part this film bored me, except for seeing all the British stars in it.",Aaron1375,"This to date is the only Harry Potter film I have sat through and watched from start to finish. I have seen bits and pieces of the others, but watching them I just feel the same thing that I did when I watched this one. In a word 'bored'. The only thing that kept me entertained was the scenery and seeing the many British A and B list stars. The most enjoyment I got out of the film is saying ""its the villain from Die Hard! he must be a bad guy!"", ""That's the dude who got messed up by Gene Hackman in Unforgiven!"", ""he was in a couple of Bond films!"", and you get the idea. The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long. Heck, by the time they are all finished they will probably remake them all again two years later.",26-May-11,3,,

How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash...,zetes,"I have, in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema, hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative, more ugly, more uninteresting, more lacking in suspense, more lacking in charm, more greedy, more incoherent... Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.
I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.
But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word ""hack"" been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?
Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable. And I thought Shrek had taken that title. 3/10",22 November 2001,3,,
Magic!,JamesHitchcock,"J. K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" novels have caught the imagination of the public like no other children's literature of recent years, not even Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"". Rowling's stroke of genius was to combine two areas of children's fiction which are normally kept separate, the world of magic and witchcraft and the world of the boarding school. (The ""school story"", dating back at least to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" from the early Victorian period, has long been a prolific source of children's literature in Britain, if less so in other countries).
The basic concept behind the stories is that, alongside the familiar everyday world, there exists a shadowy Wizarding World, all but invisible to ""muggles"" (those lacking in magical powers). The inhabitants of this world appear to be normal human beings, but possess magical abilities. Rowling's hero Harry Potter is an orphaned boy who lives in an ordinary suburban home with his unpleasant relatives, the Dursleys. Unknown to the Dursleys, Harry is secretly a wizard who has inherited magical powers from his late parents, and on his eleventh birthday he is offered a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a large Gothic building in the Scottish Highlands where all British witches and wizards are educated.
This was the first in the series of Harry Potter films. Each of Rowling's books covers the events of a single year in Harry's career at Hogwarts, and the original plan was for a new Potter film to come out every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule, however, proved too ambitious, possibly because Rowling had not actually finished writing all seven novels in 2001, and the series is not due to be completed until the release of the second part of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" in the summer of next year.
""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" essentially serves as an introduction to the series; much of the first half is taken up with introducing us to Harry, his two close friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and the various teachers, personalities and institutions which he comes across at Hogwarts. Even in the Wizarding World there are villains; indeed, like a number of other fantasy stories, like Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", the Harry Potter series was conceived as an allegory of good and evil. Like ordinary humans, wizards have the knowledge of good and evil and the moral responsibility to choose between them. A number of wizards have gone over to the ""dark side"", most prominent among them the dreaded Lord Voldemort, who was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents. The excitement really starts in the second half of the film when Harry and his friends learn of, and try to frustrate, an attempt by Voldemort to obtain the fabled Philosopher's Stone which would give him great power.
One of Rowling's stipulations was that the entire cast should be British or Irish, so this is one of the rare films to be made by a major Hollywood studio (Warner Bros.) without a single American actor. It was, nevertheless, a big success in the United States, thus disproving two major cinematic myths, namely that all successful films need at least one big-name American star and that American audiences need subtitles to understand British English, especially when spoken with a regional accent, as it is here by several of the cast including Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith. In neither case is their accent their normal one; as in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" the Essex-born Smith plays a Scottish schoolmistress, whereas Coltrane, himself from Scotland, plays the school groundsman Rubeus Hagrid with a West Country accent. Nearly all the cast are good, but the most outstanding performances come from Alan Rickman as the melancholy, morally ambiguous teacher Severus Snape and from Richard Harris as the wise, kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore was to be Harris's last great role; he died shortly after finishing the second film in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"".
The first two films, both directed by Chris Columbus, are, despite the perils which Harry and his friends have to face, generally lighter and more cheerful in tone than the later episodes in the franchise. ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is an excellent introduction to the series, magical not only in its subject-matter but also in the atmosphere of joy and wonder which Columbus is able to conjure up. Particularly memorable sequences include the Quidditch match, the scenes set in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, lit by floating candles, and the life-size game of chess near the end. A magical piece of family entertainment. 8/10",29 November 2010,8,,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,Smells_Like_Cheese,"That's it! I give up! I surrender! White flag! My friends want to see the new Harry Potter that is about to be released this summer, The Order of Phoenix, but they looked at my like I just lost my head when I told them I never saw the Harry Potter films. They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter? Well, I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films, it looked like typical kid's stuff to me. But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films, it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2+ hours each. I just finished the first one a couple days ago.
Harry Potter lives with an extremely cruel family, but there is something different about him, he can talk to snakes and make things appear and disappear. Well, he receives a letter, he's a wizard! Not just any wizard, he is the only wizard ever to survive the wrath of Voldemort, the most wicked wizard. Harry goes to a magical school, Hogwarts, where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards, Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands.
Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me, it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy. The actors were just so perfectly cast, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, we have some of England's most brilliant actors. It's a well made film, now I still haven't read the books, so I can't base this film on a comparison. Even if I did, this is the movie and the movie itself is a magical and enchanting experience. Well, I'm onto The Chamber of Secrets, wish me luck.

AKA Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,Rainey-Dawn,"I'm finally in a position to re-watch and review the Harry Potter film series - I'm way past over due for reviewing them.
First of all, I don't know of anyone that has not seen at least one Harry Potter flick. Everyone seems to agree that these are great films - I am no exception.
Secondly, the entire series is highly entertaining! If you haven't seen this series then I highly recommend you should. Comical, magical and all around fun to watch.
This first film starts out with a bang as when Hagrid, Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall show up with baby Harry Potter on the doorstep of Harry's relatives home. The film ends on a good note with the house cup being awarded. In between the beginning and ending is non-stop entertainment.
Great to watch this film again

Magical fun.,OllieSuave-007,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, this is the first film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about a young boy (Harry Potter) who is rescued from the clutches of a neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin, and taken to study witchcraft at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he meets his future lifelong friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, witches Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Harry also learns about his connection with the evil dark lord, Lord Voldemort.
I think this movie followed the J.K. Rowling's novel very well, including in it most details that capture the imagination, magic, adventure and drama of the story. Director Christopher Columbus and the team of writers and special effects people gave a pretty entertaining and believable movie. And, the acting was spot-on, most notably the brilliance of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris. The rivalry between the school houses Gryffindor and Slytherin were tastefully depicted; I just wished the other two houses, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were emphasized a little more. I didn't care too much for the Quidditch match, as I thought it was a long-drawn out ballgame.
Overall, it's a good introduction for the film series and I think is one of the best in the series as well.

"Not a terrible adaptation to this popular series, but pretty mediocre",KineticSeoul,"From what I can remember this movie has a lot of the parts in the book in the actual movie. The thing is the way the movie is executed seemed lame and poorly executed. Some scenes were done pretty well but overall it was a boring experience to sit through this whole movie. It isn't a terrible book to movie adaptation, but it just wasn't that good. A lot of movies isn't as good as the novels it is based on or adapted into and this movie is mediocre at best. And if I review this movie without reading the book, I would probably give it a lower score. Since it's this franchise that kept me interested although I am not a fan of Harry Potter novels. On a positive note I liked how almost every character looked the way I imagined them to look. The acting in this movie however is atrocious, it was like watching a live version of of a Saturday morning cartoon show. Except few of them that was alright or could actually somewhat act. Overall it's a mediocre movie that I probably wouldn't watch again unless I want to know what is going on when the sequels come out, but I doubt it since the franchise is now finished.

"The 'worst' of the series may be starting to show its age, but is still an effortlessly entertaining and enchanting experience.",Pjtaylor-96-138044,"'Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (2001)' is starting to show its age in a few areas - though, the majority of special effects still hold up remarkably well. The young actors have certainly come a long way since this first outing, but this is still an entertaining and endearing experience that's as enchanting as it is exciting. It does a great job of setting up the vibrant 'wizarding world' of which we're all now so familiar, it has some fantastically interesting concepts and well-executed ideas and it is surprisingly funny at times, too. While it may now be perhaps the 'worst' in the series, aside from the 'Fantastic Beasts' spin-off stuff (which doesn't really count, of course), it is still a wonderfully charming and enjoyable ride that's better than most of today's blockbusters. 8/10",30 April 2018,8,1,
A Fun Trip Into A Dark And Yet Wonderful Fantasy World,sddavis63,"I really hadn't expected to enjoy this movie, thinking it to be primarily directed toward children, but upon viewing it I discovered it to be a wonderful flight of fancy and fantasy, whisking the viewer into an unimaginable and yet completely believable world of wizards and magic, trolls and goblins.
It was a very impressive performance by young Daniel Radcliffe in the title role of Harry Potter, the wizard in training at the Hogwarts School of Magic who is called upon to save the day by saving the magic Philosopher's Stone from the evil Voldemort (Ian Hart.) In fact all three of the young leads were very good (Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.) They brought an appropriate zest and enthusiasm to their parts. At the other end of the age extreme, the veteran actor Richard Harris was completely believable as Professor Dumbledore. Then, of course, there was perhaps the most endearing character of all, the gentle giant groundskeeper Hagrid (played by Robbie Coltrane).
The movie is a wonderful tale, mixing in an almost ""Star Wars"" type fashion the ideas of light and dark; good and evil. While most would think of it as a children's movie, it has moments of great tension and a surprisingly complex plot to go along with the fun parts of the movie that will endear it to the hearts of many. It also has unbelievable makeup and special effects. All in all, wonderful fun to watch.

And so began a decade-defining saga...,ElMaruecan82,"""What's a Muggle?""
Two minutes after the film started and that was the first question I asked, my young brother told me the word defined people without magical abilities. A sort of wizard-goyim I guess. Anyway, I can't describe the satisfaction I felt over getting that simple information. Knowing the meaning of ""Muggle"" was strangely overwhelming.
Indeed, the series stopped almost one decade ago, started nearly two, and the books are now part of pop (and legitimate) culture and children's literature heritage... so the fact that I resisted so long gave an additional aura of mystification and I was getting my first real peek on the classic. Forget about Harry Potter, Hermione, Voldemort and Dumbledore (names I got amateurishly mixed), I lost a virginity when I knew what the Muggle was. My curiosity deepened and I was ready to embrace J.K. Rowling's universe. I wasn't a Muggle anymore.
And I was glad I waited for so long, I knew I wouldn't get all the names right, I hadn't read the books (I was a teen when the film came out), I wasn't millennial enough to be part of the Harry Potter mania unlike my brother (who's ten years younger) and had his childhood shaped by the bespectacled sorcerer, Pikachu and Lizzie McGuire. I didn't even have the basic curiosity of the average movie lover because I was never into fantasy or movies about magic to begin with. I thought such stories could provide any contrived twist or last-minute Ex Machina simply by toying with their own rules. When a curse can be done or undone, when powers leave no holds barred, what are the stakes? Where's the danger?
I'm glad I could undo the curse of my lousy stubbornness and watch for the first time the first opus of the century-defining saga ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". I enjoyed every bit of it and I found it a charm I knew was going to fade over the course of my discovery. You know when you look back to the first movies. I suspected the tone was going to get darker as the kids grow up, as JK Rowling got more confidence in her success and didn't try to make something trendy or fun. So I savored the first film not as a franchise starter, but like as a standalone, charming fantasy movie, confident that Chris Columbus was the right director and that every cast-member was the right choice.
Cast-wise, the director respected Rowling's condition before selling the book's rights so the film is a roll-call of all established British and/or Irish actors: Richard Harris as the Merlin-like wizard Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagol, scene-stealing Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid, the one who gratifies us with every information we'd need to let the plot move on despite a catchphrase that consists of ""I shouldn't have said that"". Also starring John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffith, Ian Hart, Fiona Shaw, and three baby-faced newcomers named Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.
The film is a school-case of how to get the right actors to play the right parts... and that goes for the little ones. If you examine the child actors, they're not perfect but never is the imperfection undermining the believability of their characters: they're kids with magical powers so we have to consider that their normal behavior is also conditioned by such abilities. And maybe that was the core of Harry Potter's appeal, ordinary children dealing with extraordinary powers. When they listen to advice, they know more than anyone the extent of the danger awaiting them... when they learn tricks or magical spells, they can't be too excited either, they learn it like stuff they would teach you in class.
The adult actors convey the perfect mix of normality-within-strangeness. In fact, the whole film is about an extraordinary world showed in the most mundane and matter-of-factly way, and the reason why it works so well is the same as comedy. Comedies don't feature people making other people laugh, actually, seeing someone angry can be the funniest thing. Fantasy works the same way, you can't have characters being impressed every second, let the viewers do all the wowing... but then again, Harry Potter is the newcomer so he represents our own perspective, he's got that capability to be impressed, to enjoy his powers like a ""normal"" child would do.
And that's the charm of the film: we're amazed at the magic and at Harry's own amazement, it finds the right balance between fantasy and ""reality"" in every single department: acting, storytelling and naturally set design. Hogwarts Schools looks like your typical British school with its high walls, Victorian decorations and Dickensian interiors but never exactly feels like a haunted mansion. There are also sscenes set in plain daylight with a comforting blue sky like the brooms training and the unforgettable Quidditch game.
And here and there, you have a few effects to keep you on guars. There's a scene where Harry Potter opens a book and I got my first jump scare, I like that this scary gag isn't overplayed, one is just enough, like Ebert said: it is scary but not too scary. The story never lets itself being dependent on ""effects"", and cares about Potter and his friends above everything else, providing him a promising backstory, explaining his scar on the forehead, his magical gift and why he's got a nemesis already.
On a side note, 2001 was a terrific year for the fantasy genre as it saw the release of three successful franchise: ""Shrek"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" as the most family-friendly. I read about the title's translation that the producers were afraid to use ""Philosopher"" instead of ""Sorcerer"". I think they should used the French title; ""Harry Potter and the Wizard School"", that was catchy enough without being too misleading.",11 November 2018,9,,

The casting is excellent, including the principal three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) and the teachers at Hogwarts (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris).

What a Brilliantly Fun Way to Begin a Monumental Franchise,ThomasDrufke,"If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.
I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.
Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort. In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.
But the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise. Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape. This is clearly focused on the trio, but they each get a chance to chew up some scenery with the young wizards. Everything from a clumsy giant, the dark forest, a game of quidditch, to an important game of chess make The Sorcerer's Stone one of the most memorable entries into the Potter franchise.

"An Absolute Delight for Children of all Ages,",lesleyharris30,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character. It may be a bit slow at times, but Harry Potter and the Philiosopher's Stone never loses its sense of fun and magic, and because of this it is a perfect film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.

It's 'Philosopher's Stone'!,CuriosityKilledShawn,"I'm not really a big fan of the HP films. I don't think that they translate well from the books as they are often quite long and need severe cutting down in order to fit into a 2 hour+ film. This has been increasingly evident in the later HP sequels, but Philosopher's Stone seems to be pretty much all intact.
I do find Chris Columbus' mostly naturalized approach to shooting the film to be the most appropriate. In GOF, Mike Newell had the cheap and uncheerful logic of shooting everything with a heavy green filter to make it look 'mysterious' and 'magical'. I think it just looks stupid and that the far-fetched fantasy nature is more identifiable if shot more ordinarily.
What does bug me about this film and always surprises me on repeat viewings, is how horrible the entire kiddie cast are at acting. Check out the terrible performance from the guy who plays the blandly named Oliver Wood! Woof! It's like watching some rubbish Primary School play with big budget visual effects. It takes me out of the movie every time.
The 150-minute running time seems to pass by in a breeze, something I've never really felt with the sequels. But something that bugs me is even right here at the beginning Dumbledore seems to be like 'I'll tell you about it when you're older, Harry.' Which is a cheap hook to make us read/watch the later installments.
I don't really have that much to say about Philosopher's Stone, which is why my review is short and spiceless. It's a shame the sequels had to be so boring.

I never cared for the long, boring books or the movie. So why am I writing a review about it?
I'm writing a review because I was forced to sit through it during a day in class and it was so uninteresting. The movie looked dark and ugly.
It was about a kid who was abused then he kept getting letters then the movie turned ugly then ends with the kid being the sorcerer supreme, I mean wizard..

The start of magic...,Thanos_Alfie,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first movie of the Harry Potter series and it begins a new era for the magic and for the history of Harry Potter. I liked very much this movie because it was something really new and I believe that J.K. Rowling did a great job in the writing of this. I also believe that Chris Columbus in the direction of this movie made a great job and the result was obvious.
I also liked this movie because of the plot and the story of Harry Potter and of course because of the special effects which used to this movie to achieve of being so realistic this magic. I liked the interpretations of Richard Harris who played as Professor Albus Dumbledore and Maggie Smith who played as Professor Minerva McGonagall. I believe that everyone liked the interpretations of the little actors who have been played in this movie and these are Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley).
Finally I really recommend this movie because it's an inspiring movie and if you like magic then I am sure that you will love it.",30 January 2014,7,,
This movie has a great blend of entertaining and fascinating characters and takes place in a vast and unpredictable universe,kevin_robbins,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an orphaned young man with a strange mark on his forehead who lives with his aunt, uncle and cousin. One day he is informed that he is special and is destined to attend a special school for those with magic. He is whisked off to a world like he could never imagine where he will quickly discover that he is a destined to be a savior for everyone with magic...
This movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Rent) and stars Daniel Radcliffe (Horns), Maggie Smith (Gosford Park), Rupert Grint (Moonwalkers), Warwick Davis (Willow), Verne Troyer (Austin Powers), John Hurt (Aliens) and Emma Watson (Beauty and the Beast).
The universe, magic and characters are very well established in this movie. The cast is awesome and perfectly selected to deliver these unique and fascinating characters. The mystery of Harry's past creates a level of intensity and unpredictably in every circumstance. The school layout and games are depicted brilliantly with great CGI and special effects. The final conclusion was well delivered and helped build the comradery between characters they'll need in the following film.
This movie has a great blend of entertaining and fascinating characters and takes place in a vast and unpredictable universe. This is an absolute must see that I would score a 9/10.",24 January 2022,9,,

A gentle introduction to a captivating world,tomgillespie2002,"With billions upon billions of pounds in revenue generated from book sales, film adaptations and all other mediums, and with the hysteria surrounding the series now all but gone, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit the Harry Potter film franchise. I'll state outright that I'm a fan of the books: they are hardly ground-breaking pieces of literature, but they are a meticulously crafted and widely imaginative set of novels, maturing with it's progression and with the age of it's characters and readers. The movie adaptations were consistently average, fiercely loyal to J.K. Rowling's prose but always somewhat lacking in substance.
Shut away in the cupboard under the stairs by his adoptive parents (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw), 11 year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives an unhappy life. But there's something different about him, as he learns when he talks to a snake at a zoo and makes the protective glass disappear, causing his vile cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) to fall into the tank. His life changes when he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The invitations are burned by the Dursleys, and they go to great lengths to stop him going to a place that will teach him magic, until he is rescued by a hairy giant named Reubus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).
When introduced into the magical world with Hagrid, Harry learns that he is famous. His parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort (generally referred to as You-Know-Who), but Harry survived the attack, seemingly killing Voldemort and inflicting Harry with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. When he gets to Hogwarts, he is befriended by the bumbling Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the precocious Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three are quickly embroiled in a plot involving murdered unicorns, a mysterious artefact known as the philosopher's stone, and a giant three-headed dog.
Philosopher's Stone is almost defiantly faithful to the books. Sure, lines are altered here, and minor characters are snipped out there, but this is as close as literally 'bringing a book to life' gets. Yet while this works in it's favour in terms of visualising Rowling's creations, it doesn't even try to develop any ideas of it's own that would have only worked in a visual medium. Much of Rowling's silly and charming sense of humour is lost in simply filming whatever happens on the pages. One of the main criticism's I have for the books is that a lot of the major characters are little more than archetypes, so a lot rested on the three young leads' shoulders in making us interested enough to stick with them.
Sadly, two of the three fall rather flat, with only the gurning and hang-dog Rupert Grint showing a natural gift for appearing on the big screen. Potter is a simple enough character anyway, at least he is at this point of the story, shy, naive but brave, but Radcliffe gives an incredibly one-note performance, encapsulated in the scene in which he discovers he can perform magic. ""I'm a... wizard?"" he says, lacking anything resembling a facial expression. Watson also struggles to bring much likability to her self-satisfied bookworm, her eyebrows constantly rising and falling as she struggles to perform her lines with any conviction.
For the rest of the cast, director Chris Columbus has rounded up a smorgasbord of British and Irish talent, a collection of well-trained thespians who steal the entire film from it's leads. Richard Harris plays Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster, Maggie Smith is Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor, the house Harry is chosen for, Alan Rickman is Professor Snape, Harry's greasy-haired Potions teacher, and John Hurt makes a small appearance as a wand-maker. Coltrane probably steals the film as the beast-loving grounds-keeper Hagrid. It's an amazing line-up that would consistently grow both in talent and in numbers as the films progressed.
Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a success, weaving an interesting enough story about the possible return of the dark lord Voldemort, with Harry's wide-eyed introduction to the world of hocus pocus. John Williams' Oscar-nominated and now widely recognisable score captures some of the giddy movie magic of early Spielberg, and the attention to detail is often remarkable. But like the book, it ultimately suffers from being too kid-friendly, spoon-feeding lessons in morality without giving much for adults to chew on. It's little more than a well-told children's story, something that would change as the novels became darker and more complex, but at this point, it's a gentle introduction to a captivating world.",12 July 2014,5,,
"Love the book, hate the movie",digitalbeachbum,"A great book being made in to a subpar movie. There is no denying that anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece of a 10/10 is nothing more than fanboy fanfare hardon for Harry. Period.

Alan Rickman is amazing, as well much of the supporting cast. The direction is meh. The cinematography is meh. The CG is awful. The script is terrible. There are continuity issues with how magic is used. The characters are inconsistent. There are plenty of fallacies and deus ex machina moments. It could have been so much more.",26-May-20,1,2,
Visual Awe Vaults It Even Over Book,zkonedog,"If you watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.
For a basic plot summary, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.). Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage. Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a ""Wizard Academy"" of sorts, to begin his training. While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.
In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step. There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few ""facts"" from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.
In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book. Why? Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters. For some, the ""mystery is gone"" when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.
The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of ""epic-ness"" to it. It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.
Thus, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes. The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into.",4 March 2017,9,,
Faithful to the book.,filipemanuelneto,"This film is an adaptation of the first book of Harry Potter's saga, written by the British author J.K. Rowling. Directed by Chris Columbus, a man with experience in making films for young audiences (""Home Alone"" is paradigmatic), this film has a very young cast led by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, in the roles of the apprentices wizards Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, while also features veterans actors of the British theater and cinema, as Richard Harris (in one of his last appearances in movies before his death), Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, in the roles of Professor Dumbledore, school's headmaster, his main collaborator, Professor McGonagall and the school's gamekeeper, Hagrid.
This film marks the start of one of the most acclaimed and profitable franchises in the twenty-first century cinema, where several acting careers met its beginning or end. The film practically doesn't have a single negative note: he managed to pick up a book that was already a huge success and amplify it astronomically without sacrificing its authenticity. Anyone who has read the book recognizes it in this film and sees the book's magic gaining life, body and shape. The special effects, the details of the scenario, the costumes (any similarity between the school robes and the traditional black cloaks of university students of Portugal is not a mere coincidence, since Rowling lived in Portugal and has even married a Portuguese) all contribute to make us feel that this movie is the book we read and we have on our hands. Phenomenal, one of the best adaptations of a novel.",5 September 2015,9,,
moments of magic and imagination make this a superior movie,didi-5,"Overshadowed by the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when it was first released, this opening entry in the Harry Potter franchise is quirky, magical, and full of charm. Daniel Radcliffe, as Potter, shines as the boy wizard just beginning to realise his potential and his fate.
Special effects are memorable - the constant stream of letters luring Harry to Hogwarts, the snake pit, the colour changes of house colours, the game of Quiddich. And the acting is stellar from veterans Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris (when comparing his Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's it would have been fascinating to see both actors tackle the character at all stages in the series to see how their interpretations would develop; sadly Harris died after film two, necessitating a cast change).

Pure magic (dvd),leplatypus,"It's the best movie of the best book.
It has everything: a original story, an incredible cast, a talented production. It's a really breath of air, compared to today blockbuster where CGI is indigent and to later Potter movies (the Yates period) where everything turns darks.
Watching those first steps makes me understand two things:
First, when a movie involves kid, their credibility lies upon the creativity of the director. Indeed, Columbus was the finest choice for the job after what he has done in ""Home alone"". Here, he gives his young cast the perfect suggestions. I believed a lot of people find the movie too much eye-candy but it's what the book is about: stepping into a new universe filled with magical things and with kids. So, the crucial thing was to have this feeling of amazement.
Next, Potter is the best piece of fantasy since ""Star Wars"". I really don't see others fiction works that can make dream kids and adult as well in the 1990 and 2000. The only regret we can get is that the first stories are really educational for kids whereas the last stories, starting with HPATOFP, are too much about violence, death, war and killings. I really can't accept the high dose of violence the young generation is exposed today because life is above all about fighting inner demons than bad people! How can they discover what courage means when the only solution they see is to punch, kick, kill the one who are against them. our actual societies are becoming like Sparta and thus, in those earlier movies of Potter and in this one, particularly, there was at least still place for innocence.",23 March 2012,10,,
My review of Harry Potter And The Philospher's Stone,lisafordeay,,22 April 2017,7,,
Book-lovers will be excited to see it all come to life,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"When a beloved book is given the big-screen treatment, there's always the excitement factor of getting to see what was once only in your head come to life right before your eyes. That excitement was 100-fold, however, with J.K. Rowling's smash-hit fantasy series beginning with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" With that much anticipation, there are some serious expectations for Warner Brothers' behemoth franchise-to-be, and gladly the pay-off of seeing it all for the first time makes ""Sorcerer's Stone"" a success with Potter fans.
As for those who never picked up the book, there might be a good portion among them who aren't left spellbound. The enormous project suffers a bit out of fear of failing the fans, which is fair as they're the target audience -- along with families in general. That's where the choice for Chris Columbus to produce and direct becomes the level-headed choice. With credits including both ""Home Alone"" films and ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" Columbus clearly knows how to work with kids -- and there is a lot of that work needing to be done with young actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson taking most of the screen time. All three are quite talented for having barely a credit to their names and Columbus deserves much of the praise for their performance.
The rest of the cast is pretty remarkable: a who's who of outstanding British acting (and some Scottish). Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonnagal, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, John Hurt as Mr. Olivander, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman who is brilliantly chilling as the mean, stone-faced Professor Snape. Each of them clearly talented enough to bring these characters to life not just visually but with complexity. They are like the respected elders of the film and we bow our heads to them.
At the same time, the first Harry Potter is a much more childish film full of good vs. evil cliché. Maybe the attribution should go to the desire to not get slapped with anything more than a PG rating, which is understandable, but it dilutes the mystique of the novels. The art direction (with lavish sets and costumes) makes the film carry its own magical quality just like the book, but it's the dramatic storytelling that's not as breath-taking.
Part of that problem belongs to the challenge of adapting the book. Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") proves an interesting choice, but I wouldn't wish this assignment on anyone. Kloves opts for taking the maximum time producers would give him (two and a half hours -- too much for a family film) and crams as much book material as he can into it. Not exactly the best way to do it, but the safest as far as fan-pleasing goes. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" ends up vaulting from scene to scene and the result is that Harry goes from boy who didn't know wizards existed to wizard student with the knowledge that strangers wouldn't just carry dragon eggs in about an hour and a half. The story still gives Harry time to charm us and express his fears and wishes to know his parents, but his hero's journey is undermined by sheer desire to fill the screen with as many magical elements from the book as possible.
""Sorcerer's Stones"" will certainly satisfy fans' itches and entertain them at a high level of quality, which I can say falling into that category, but it's a bit too much like a really long race because of its commitment to book obedience (and I'm sure plenty was missing too). But seeing it all come to life is enough to entertain the masses and provoke the imaginations of nearly all who sit down and watch.",4 July 2009,7,,

Lord of the Stone!,Anonymous_Maxine,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in close proximity to the great Lord of the Rings, and while this has happened many times before with the general result that one of the two films is widely, although not always correctly, considered inferior to the other (Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact, etc.), this has surprisingly not been the case with these films. Clearly, The Lord of the Rings is a much more mature and bold film, but the first installment in the Harry Potter series is much more than a childish adventure tale. One of the things that really makes it a great film is that the film is so faithful to the book. The writers and director Chris Columbus wisely decided not to take any creative liberties with the material that they had to work with. I am glad to see this, because literary faithfulness is almost always associated with better adapted films, and it's good to know that no one involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone felt the need to improve upon a book that has been justifiably described as a `publishing phenomenon.'
J.K Rowling has created a brilliant adventure masterpiece with her first novel, which she reportedly began writing in some café in England back when she was a struggling single mother, and Chris Columbus has successfully taken on the daunting task of bringing it to the screen. One of the things that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has in common with The Lord of the Rings is that they both bring the audience to entirely new worlds, with the added bonus in Harry Potter that we actually start out in the real world (to some extent) and travel to the world of witches and wizards with the equally amazed Harry Potter.
On a structural level, Harry Potter takes an age-old underdog winning formula and reformulates it to make it interesting again. We get a surprisingly simple version of the good vs. bad structure that Star Wars exemplifies so well as Harry faces off with his pals in Griffindor against the obviously malicious Draco Malfoy (what a name!) and the rest of Slytherin. There is a surprising amount of characterization going on in this film even at the level of their actual names, to such extent that a couple of Draco's loyal goons have names like Crabbe and Goyle. Real charmers, I'm sure.
Obviously, in a film with this much fantasy and adventure, there is a definite need for some amount of computer-generated special effects. You just can't have a fight with a fully-grown mountain troll or a game of Quidditch played on broomsticks or a lot of the magic that took place in the movie without them, but thankfully they were wise enough not to take the special effects too far, a mistake the ease of which to make George Lucas is happily proving. The problem with computer-generated images these days is that no matter how huge the budget is or how high tech the images are, they NEVER look completely real. Chris Columbus seems to realize this, as can be seen, for example, in the Quidditch game, in which all of the players zooming around on their brooms are generally shown from a distance, so that the only way that we can tell that they aren't real, with a few exceptions, is that we've never seen someone in real life riding a flying broom. Given the fact that a game played entirely on flying brooms was made to look at least moderately convincing, we're more than willing to forgive the relatively few scenes in which the level of reality slips a little bit (such as the scene where the mountain troll is hanging Harry by his foot, swinging at him with his club).
The casting in the film, as well, could not possibly have been better. 12 year-old Daniel Radcliffe perfectly captures the unique character of Harry Potter, and his young friends in the film are portrayed by a series of preteen newcomers as well. The surprising thing here is not only that most of the children with lead roles in the film are very new to film acting, but that Chris Columbus managed to coax such convincing performances out of all of them (obviously, being fans of wonderful adventure tales such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we all remember director Richard Donner mentioning in the director's commentary on The Goonies DVD that working with children made him contemplate suicide on a daily basis). Robbie Coltrane delivers the performance of his career as the lovable Hagrid, the gigantic Gamekeeper with the heart of gold and the clumsily loose tongue, while Richard Harris and Maggie Smith fit so well in their roles that they seem to have been written specifically for them (each easily reaching the incredible level of precision with which Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee each fit into their respective roles in The Lord of the Rings). And, of course, I can't forget Alan Rickman, who is so perfectly cast as Severus Snape that the role could not have been filled half as well by any other actor. Rickman has been unfortunately typecast since his absolutely brilliant performance in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and his role here as Snape is hardly a notch or two below that one.
Clearly, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is aimed at a relatively younger audience, since the books are aimed at a young adult audience, but the film manages to entertain children and adults alike, just as the books are easily enjoyable by any adult who is at least slightly in touch with his or her inner child. It is not often that a book or series of books as fascinating as the Harry Potter books comes along, and it's great to see that, just like The Lord of the Rings, the series is off to a smashing good start. I wish they would make movies out of some of the other adventure books that are just as fun to read as the Harry Potter books, such as The Phantom Tollbooth or The Chronicles of Narnia (someone's sitting on a gold mine with that one!!), but for now, I am personally more than content to sit back and watch a new Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings film for the next couple years, and hope that this trend of quality adventure will continue in the future.",17 June 2002,10,,
A Fine Commercial and Social Product,jzappa,"Gone With the Wind was another literary phenomenon that produced a film rendering that had to meet equally exacting fan qualifications. It's comparable in the sense that everyone had an attitude about the casting, which in due course resulted wonderfully. The novelists required a loyalty to the manuscript, which was respected. Directors were enlisted who could be relied upon to deferentially work for the material. Immeasurable arithmetic was done while constructing the corporal worlds of the novels. Producers challenged standard constraints about running time to incorporate all the indispensable narrative episodes.
On a hushed suburban London street, owls emerge, a cat transforms into Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltraine relinquishes a bundled infant to a doorstep. Harry Potter, an urchin who keeps extraordinarily buoyant despite the never-ending bitterness and cruelty allotted by the intolerant aunt and uncle with whom he's been left, is kept in a cubbyhole, tormented by his browbeating cousin, forbidden from opening the officially addressed envelopes that inexplicably begin arriving for him. The relatives are stunned when the same leviathan, Hagrid, arrives on Harry's 11th birthday to notify him that he's indeed the son of two slain wizards and is now welcome to grace Hogwarts. Very smartly, this is all done with tongue lodged in cheek and rewarded by temporary comeuppance.
The reason this near-ideal product holds up so well from age ten to twenty owes to its humor, its light-hearted youthful nature, though it's clear that Chris Columbus cuts and arranges his camera very capriciously and isn't the ideal filmmaker for staging action dramatically or developing with deliberate accent, depending instead on FX and John Williams' tiringly hectic score to punch up crucial moments. Nevertheless, it's all on the right tonal level, as we're absconded into a world immortalized to an unusually engaging extent by production design, locations, effects and actors. The key, naturally, is Radcliffe. Young Daniel's standard facial appearance, unkempt dark hair, sheer eyes, round spectacles make an instantaneously adorable Harry. He's an average underdog whose continuing comprehension of his uncommon power I believe.
When, at 40 minutes in, the school is finally seen, kids paddling across a lake at night toward its soaring spires on a bastion-style outcrop, the film establishes a sought-after atmosphere of marvel and mystery about what lies ahead. Maggie Smith recurs as Professor McGonagall, who heads the much-repeated ""sorting"" of students arbitrated in the immense Great Hall by a pleasant talking hat. Harry, Weasley and Hermione wind up together in Gryffindor, while their little arch-rival Malfoy is allocated to Slytherin, where Alan Rickman's ham-handedly fearsome Professor Snape rules. Mysteriously, a feast materializes on the endless tables, ghosts gracefully flutter around, paintings are flesh, stairways reposition unexpectedly.
Throughout a decidedly action-packed school year, it appears someone wicked is scheming to purloin the eponymous Stone for Voldemort, a matchless wizard who's been without power since he slaughtered Harry's parents but couldn't quite dispose of the child. The stone lies beyond a trap door fortified by a massive three-headed dog absurdly named Fluffy. In a jam-packed chain of events from such highlights as Harry's night-time rovings in his invisibility cloak and seeing his late parents in a conjuring mirror to eluding Fluffy into a full-scale chessboard, the young threesome has its nerve and cleverness weathered to the utmost in a clash of obvious good versus evil, though the chess match alas underscores violence over suspense.
Harry's found to be so skillful at piloting a broomstick that he's made star player on Gryffindor's team in Quidditch, a staggeringly unsafe sport that has its pre-pubescent players hundreds of feet above an arena on brooms in frantic pursuit of very hard high-speed balls. The airborne element is excellently achieved visually, but the Quidditch match itself is one sequence that indulges speed with suspense and loudness with excitement without the support of narrative motion.
Regardless, the cast recompenses flat out, especially the sweetly extroverted Emma Watson as the prying, sharp-witted Hermione, and Rupert Grint, whose Weasley grows charmingly from a perfectly nebbishy second-banana comic foil into indispensable sidekick. On the grown-up front, Coltrane is foremost among contemporaries, yet it's no revelation how superlatively such authorities as Smith, Rickman, John Hurt, Richard Harris as the white-maned Dumbledore, Ian Hart as the enigmatic Quirrell and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the nervously conventional Dursleys are brilliant.
By and large, the vast effects are exceptional and pleasing. Some of the creature work, like the centaur, even calls to mind Harryhausen's pioneering stop-motion. The costumes are another spring for repeated amusement, while John Seale's widescreen lensing substantially proliferates everything across the screen. If all movies acquisitively allocated as cinematic franchises could be as spotlessly considered as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there'd be no incentive to lament cinema's asinine commodification.",18-May-11,8,,
A brilliant start to the fantastic franchise...,taylorkingston,,01-May-15,9,,
Nicolas Flamel Strikes Again,robert-temple-1,"As the first of the famous Harry Potter films, this one managed to restrain its special effects sufficiently not to overwhelm the viewers with too many dazzling visuals at the expense of the story and the amusing characters. The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is.",13 April 2009,9,,

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,JoBloTheMovieCritic,10/10 - an unforgettable start to a fantastic film series and the career of the impeccable Emma Watson (and the other kids),31 August 2019,10,1,
A good start to an excellent franchise,freemantle_uk,"Yet face, if a book sales well, it is bound to made into a film, regardless of quality, or even if it is filmable. This is true for books like Twilight, the Golden Compass (or Northern Lights what it's really called) and Dan Brown's thrillers. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series became one of the most popular series of books of all time, appealing to children and adults. There were written in a assessable style, with a clear and strong narrative, but with a good deal of backstory. A film adaption became enviable.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book, and film of the series, starting with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as an 11-year-old boy, raised as a regular human (muggle) child by his aunt and uncle. He is abused, forced to live in a small cupboard under the stairs whiles his cousin is spoiled rotten. But Harry's life is changed when he finds out that he had been admitted to Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches. He discoveries that he is a celebrity in the wizardry world, but does not know his own family history. Whiles in Hogwarts Harry makes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the three end up working together. Harry becomes the new star of the Quidditch team, and Hermione is the brains of the operation. The three believe that a threat to Hogwarts, with the Dark Wizard Lord Voldermort wanting the Philosopher's Stone hidden in Hogwarts and using his old follower Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) to get it.
When this film was in pre-production a number of big-name directors were attached, including Terry Gilliam, M. Night Shyamalan, Alan Parker, Brad Silberling, Baz Luhrmann and even Steven Spielberg. Spielberg planned making the film animated with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice, luckily this never got off the ground. J.K. Rowling preferred was Terry Gilliam, an excellent director with great vision, but could be a handful with the film going overbudget. Warner Brothers settled for Chris Columbus, a director with a decent reputation for family films, like Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire. He offers a steady hand, knowing what to do, having fun with CGI and light moments of comedy, as well trying to be like Spielberg involving sentimental moments. But he is not so good on the darker elements of the story, hedge why other directors were brought in for later films. Columbus is basically a safe pair of hands to start things off until the films could stand on their own legs.
J.K. Rowling insisted that the cast for the film should have been all British and Irish. The studio played alone and it was a wise move, much like the Bond movies. It was have betrayed fans and non-fans to see an American Harry with either him in end up going to England or transferring the action to America. There is an excellent cast with actors like Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, just to name a few. The type of film Harry Potter is it did not need a massive A-Lister like Brad Pitt or Will Smith, just good actors. The young actors who played the main three actors were however, not great. They were young, child actors with little experience, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint only acted in school plays. They do however improve in latter films, and we can forgive them because they were young and Chris Columbus isn't known for getting great performers from actors.
The Philosopher's Stone is the most light-hearted of the films. They is good action and a fun story. Making the film a good start to the Harry Potter series, keeping it going to 2011.",4 November 2009,8,,
a good film with lots to please the eye but still has its ups and downs,Special-K88,,9 April 2007,0,0,
"Abracadabra! Voila! Boy, what a wizard",dfranzen70,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a 10-year old British lad who has a zigzag scar on his forehead. He lives with his aunt and uncle and rotund, snotty cousin, who thoroughly despise him and make him live in a cupboard below a staircase. And all looks quite lost until the day Harry receives an invitation to attend the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he's carried away by the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).
Harry quickly learns that his mom and dad were a witch and wizard, respectively, and that they died while protecting him from the superevil Voldemort (also known as He Who Must Not Be Named); but Harry also learns that there's something about him that protects him from Voldemort. With his trusted new friends Ron and Hermione, Harry must find out what's in the trap door at Hogwarts that's guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy - and that certain bad guy or guys wants to get a hold of.
As serious as the plot seems, this is a most fanciful movie. It's quick paced, so as not to let the little kippers fall asleep, and is full of all of the dazzling effects you'd expect from a wizards and witches movie. It has quite a few things going for it (it did make a zillion dollars, so it must have something going for it), including a brisk, crisp script that's pretty close to the book, excellent performances from top to bottom, and those omnipresent effects that by now are fairly workaday to most of us.
Author J. K. Rowling insisted that all of the cast - or at least those with speaking roles - be British, and as a result we get some of England's finest: Richard Harris (who's actually Irish), John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Ian Hunt, John Cleese, Richard Griffith, Julie Walters, Coltrane, and Alan Rickman. It's a magnificent roster, and each actor appears to be having a great time playing dress-up and spouting some downright hilarious lines.
This is a popcorn movie. Is it a date movie? Um, no. Your date might think you're an idiot if you sit down to watch this. But it IS a great movie to watch with your kids, and you might even get them to read the books. And hey, anything that gets kids to read something thicker than a pamphlet is usually a good thing.
Plus the special effects merely enhance the show; they aren't the show itself. The real star is the precocious Radcliffe (who's been signed to a few more Potter films, by the way) , who essays the young magician perfectly. Too often kids come off as snotty or impossibly cute in movies; Radcliffe is neither, and neither, by extension, is Harry Potter. I've seen too many films in which the kids are nothing more than glorified brats, even when they're the heroes - but not our fair Mr. Potter, who saves the day through his courage, wits, and intelligence. Oh yes, and love.",4 June 2002,8,,
"A Cheery, if Inconsequential, Foray That Merely Scratches the Surface of Harry's World",drqshadow-reviews,"Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.",8 July 2013,7,0,
"I think it's as good as the book, but it's all sorcerical.",GiraffeDoor,"For me, the movies will always be a mixed bag and even the first one has its logistical problems.
But if you have no experience with the franchise at all, I would ask you to please give this movie a chance. Although it suffers a lot from jolty pacing at times, there is not a dull moments with so much neat design, visual intelligence and sheer imagination in selling this fantasy of the British public school that happens to also be magic. (Public school means private school, here. And my compatriots say Americans can't speak English!)
The narrative is fragmented by I like its style as a compendium of adventures that fall into one over arching adventure as we discover a new world alongside our adorable everyboy, a world that also happens to be familiar to the target demographic, playing up our fears of belonging and keeping up while indulging the fantasy of escaping annoying relatives to become a hero in a place where anything seems possible, except getting to school on time!
If you can just role with the cheesy kids' movie feel, it can be a real treasure with an evening's sky worth of acting talent really selling the illusion especially Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant and Maggie Smith as the frightening transfiguration teacher.
It's as funny and chicly formidable as you'd expect but it really does earn its moments of pathos as well. The ending always sort of makes me want to cry (in the good way).",11 March 2020,8,,

Welcome to Hogwarts-part 1...,MaxBorg89,"Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (I prefer to use the original British title) is a wonderful experience: good script, great visuals, extraordinary actors... However, there's a ""but"", which is the following: it's excessively faithful to the source novel, leaving out only one or two side characters. The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other ""part 1 of 3"" movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s). In this case, Chris Columbus, best known for Home Alone includes as much as possible also to make sure the target audience (kids) will enjoy it, adult viewers being more used to differences between book and film (and thus perhaps likely to find the running time a bit excessive).
Nonetheless,the movie is great, Columbus using all the tools at his disposal to bring J. K. Rowling's enchanted universe to the screen. And the magic is in every single frame: from potions to talking hats to Quidditch games, it's pretty clear nothing ordinary can possibly happen, and all of it looks real, thanks to brilliantly accomplished special effects and CGI. But the movie's strength doesn't lie only in the visual aspect: there's also an impressive ensemble cast, consisting of some of Britain's finest actors. All of them are impressive, but it si of course the adult section of the cast that pulls off a superior job, having more experience and knowing how to add substance to an array of fascinating characters (standouts include Robbie Coltrane as a gigantic caretaker, Alan Rickman as a sinister teacher and of course Richard Harris, who plays Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore with unmatched charm and warmth).
Aside from a few ""slow"" bits, this is a good start for what will certainly be one of the defining franchises of the 21st century.
To paraphrase Dumbledore: let the feast begin...",20 November 2005,8,,
Alohomora! It opens!,adamjohns-42575,"As I was watching this film, probably for the 100th time, I realised how many of the great cast had sadly passed on - Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Richard Griffiths and Verne Troyer - and it reminded me that this film is nearly 20 years old! I remember going to the cinema to see it with my Mum and insisting that she buy the books for me for Christmas, which, God bless her, she did and I devoured them, furious that the next instalment (Book 5) was still at least months away. I also insisted that she knit me a Gryffindor scarf, which she did, but I didn't know about it, because it wasn't finished until 15 years later (I'm actually always too hot to wear it, but I like that she made it for me - Don't tell her!). I didn't realise at the time how much room Harry and his world would take up in my life. I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey alongside Mr Potter, especially with my Niece, who is quite possibly the biggest HP nerd out there (Even if she does watch it without me sometimes).
As a result of that initial beginning I have always found that I read the part of Dumbledore as Richard Harris, his replacement, although very good, is not quite the wizard I read in the first 5 and later the 6th and 7th books, before Mr Harris left us and we never had that recipe again. I think he made a fantastic Albus and wish he'd managed to hold on those few more years. After all Maggie did the whole 8 films with Cancer. How very selfish of him to leave us wanting more!
As a first film in a series, it's not bad and definitely gets you interested and I understand that the films/books age with Harry and the Reader/Viewer, but looking back, this film is clearly aimed at a younger audience, with some quite silly elements and characters played for laughs. In particular, I find the three leads a bit of a bunch of Goofy Goobers in the first two films and I'm delighted when they come back for year three, having clearly had some form of acting lessons, not to mention the new take on the films. This one, however, does the job, like I say and at the time that I first watched it, I didn't think I would see a film to beat it. It's funny how quickly a film can age. It's full of great characters, fun and laughs, interesting scenarios and definitely gets you hooked to find out what happens next. It's obvious that it's a good film, because they kept going with the rest of the series.
The CGI is very much of its time and the broomstick rides especially, show up those flaws, but if you don't look to hard while you're watching it with the kids on a wet Sunday with a hot chocolate, you'll be fine.
As the first film it has to set the seen for a much larger tale, which it does very nicely, while still remaining a story in its own right. If you didn't like this one, at least you have an ending, but if you want more, you can clearly see that it's on its way.
Great performances by the teaching cast. I miss Alan (Thanks for doing all 8 films before you left us) and I hope that Maggie Smith is wrapped in cotton wool somewhere to keep her safe, long may she reign!",2 November 2020,7,,
One of the weaker Potter films,MissSimonetta,"Though I enjoy the novels, the Harry Potter film adaptations have always been hit and miss affairs for me. Outside of about two of them, most of the entries in the movie franchise are either charmless and bland or stylish but incomprehensible to people who have not read the books. Sorcerer's Stone is in the former category.
Chris Columbus' ""whimsical"" direction is lifeless. The overly lit visuals are boring and the whole thing just feels like an exposition dump. The child actors give stiff performances (not coming into their own until about the third installment). The adults are a touch better but cannot do much with the awkward book to screen treatment. The only excellent aspect of the film is John Williams' score, which evokes the wonder, mystery, and warmth of the original book more than the actual movie does.",29 October 2013,6,0,
It has stood the test of time as one of the greatest fantasy movies of the twenty-first century,kluseba,"I have recently been revisiting the Harry Potter franchise during the ongoing pandemic and I have been wondering whether these movie that I hadn't seen in a decade would have aged well or not. My conclusion is that most of them have aged particularly well and this is especially the case for the first two movies that I consider the best of the franchise. The producers' idea to hire veteran director Chris Columbus was certainly a decisive one in hindsight since he managed to transform a first novel with numerous lengths into an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.
The movie has numerous other strengths that need to be pointed out. Even two decades later, the special effects still look stunning and do the great novel series justice. The visual effects are magical, the sound effects are epic and the lighting techniques increase the movie's multiple shifts in atmosphere.
The locations have been chosen with care as well. Harry Potter's home looks as boring, desolate and exchangeable as it's described in the novel. The scene at the lighthouse oozes with atmosphere. King's Cross busy Platform 9 3/4 looks very colourful, detailed and imaginative. The extraordinary train ride to Hogwarts invites to dream yourself far away. The highlight is obviously Hogwarts and its surroundings as nearly every section in this gigantic castle comes around with creative details and imaginative surprises.
The film certainly convinces with its detailed storytelling and diversified subplots. It takes all the time it needs to introduce us to numerous most entertaining classes at Hogwarts. The sections that show and explain Harry Potter's Quidditch career are so detailed that even someone who hasn't read the novel will understand how this fascinating wizarding sport works. The film carefully and credibly develops the friendship between lead characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Everything is however wrapped up perfectly in an adventurous, entertaining and epic finale where the three protagonists have to face numerous challenges related to the main plot as an impostor is aiming to steal the mysterious Sorcerer's Stone for a most sinister purpose.
The young actresses and actors are doing excellent jobs and are truly convincing in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe shines as confused and isolated but soon enough adventurous and imaginative young wizard going through dynamic changes. Rupert Grint excels as friendly but clumsy young wizard who you are going to appreciate right from the start. Emma Watson shines as self-confident, intellectual and slightly arrogant young wizard whose academic performances are incredibly inspiring. The adult actors have also been chosen with care. Richard Harris's performance as principal Albus Dumbledore is the best ever for this role as he convinces as wise, patient and kind mentor that you will like right from the start. My personal highlight is Alan Rickman as cold, gloomy and unpredictable professor who seems to be antagonist and protagonist all at once.
In the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not only the only movie that I prefer over its novel version in the franchise but also one of the two best movies in the inspiring fantasy film franchise that has left a significant mark on an entire generation of children and teenagers two decades ago. The film has aged quite well and should still impress children and teenagers as well as their parents all around the world nowadays. The movie has been executed with care in every single department and has lost nothing of its unique charm. It would go as far to state that it stands as one of the very best fantasy movies of the twenty-first century.",26 November 2020,10,,

Inventive fantasy film...,dwpollar,"1st watched 11/20/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Chris Columbus): Inventive fantasy film that appeals to young school-age kids in many different ways. As I watched this movie in the theatre, surrounded by middle school kids, I understood why they are captivated by this character, Harry Potter. Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about. I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time). This is even fun to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes). All in all this movie is basically a good time had for all. Not taken seriously it is very appealing to people of all ages.",22 November 2001,7,,
Slavishly Faithful Adaptation,noralee,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is devotedly faithful to the book.
The special effects, especially the Henson Creature Shop and the quidditch game, are fun, but not fantastically magical.
There's a lot riding on those three kid leads, more than probably any kids can communicate; it makes one realize how much of the book really takes place inside Harry's head.
The great British character actors are underutilized, especially John Cleese as nearly Headless Nick.
The music is too loud and obvious.
A must for fans of the books but this won't make any converts. It is long -- don't take kids too young to read the book; the little kids in our audience were screaming to go home already.

People really take this one for granted because if this was a horrible flop or even just mediocre, there may not have been a series or the rest of the films would has suffered.

HP 1,questl-18592,"So, to set the scene a little bit, I believe this is the third time I've seen this movie. I read the nearly all the books when they came out and watched just the first one when it released and then, over lockdown pounded out the whole series. Thought I'd come back to it again and give it a more critical eye.
The Somebody's Stone is an interesting film. There's so much nostalgia here for me and I can't help but enjoy that and yet, I never find myself drawn into this one. It's a decent introduction but it feels off to me every time. It has this odd mixture of young and mature themes that I don't think quite hit their perfect balance yet, though an argument could be made that as the movies progress so to do their maturity and intricacies to match the plot but still, as a single film this feels like a child's movie with childish issues. The child actors, for a start, are going a bit over the top and it feels like we could use a Looney Tunes sound effects track to go with some of the things happening here. Also, I can't help but be annoyed by the wish fulfillment involved. Poor orphan boy is suddenly the chosen one and becomes a huge deal at school, wildly popular and rich in both gold and friends without ever even trying!
That all may sound like I'm really bagging on this but I don't mean to. I still think this is a good movie but every time I see it I'm reminded of why I abandoned the series so early on upon it's original release.

Lush lavish orchestrations and endlessly inventive use of individual instruments, and soaring emotional oceans of music. Most acting chops are right, the casting deserves an Oscar of its own, every film, and the delight in seeing, film by film, each young actor journey through their teens to genuine human wonder.

A Magical Film!,moviewizguy,"Harry Potter is an average bespectacled 11 year old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason the family has always mistreated him. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.
This film is a great adaptation of the book, not to mention the other Harry Potter movies. It's filled with magic and takes you in a world where it can only exists in fairy tales but this movie shows you it can be real. I loved the score for the film. It's sounds magical-like.
To be honest, I was never a fan of the Harry Potter books. My cousin gave me book #1 and #4 for Christmas (I don't know about books #2 and #3) and I never read them. Then I bought the first movie with interest and all of a sudden, I'm a huge fan of this series. I loved all the books and the movies!
Daniel Radcliffe plays a great Harry Potter as well with the perfect casting by Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The whole sets in the film are wonderful. I love the action sequences and the CGI in the film (there aren't many). This movie is not all about the action and CGI and modern technology. It has a great story filled with humor, emotion, and suspense.
This film doesn't feel long. It's a great family film with magical sets, action sequences, story, and comedic scenes. If you are a fan or a non-fan of the book, either way, you will enjoy the film tremendously. It's the Wizard of Oz of our time!",21 June 2007,8,,

Nice but unbalanced,valadas,"The first part of the movie is very good with an excellent re-creation of the atmosphere imagined by J. K Rowling in the book on which it was inspired. All visual special effects are very imaginative and of very good quality. The characters are well designed and very convincing. The human nature (bad or good) of these wizards is extremely well shaped and their performances extremely charming. Well this is true for the first part of the movie which shows, so to speak, the presentation of Hogwarth, the wizard school and its masters and students with a special prominence of the main character of Harry Potter (a well chosen charming child actor) and his two companions Hermione and Ron. However the second part in which the main plot of the searching for the sorcerer's stone develops itself, is much less brilliant in terms of imagination and special effects, becoming sometimes a bit dull and commonplace.",24 December 2008,6,0,
For fans only,Terryfan,"Now the reason I make that statement is because you have to be a fan of Harry Potter to have enjoy this movie or you have to be a fan of wizard movies to better enjoy.
I remember seeing this movie in theaters with family members that I didn't hang out with much and I remember how cold it was outside in the theater but when we went inside the movie theater room to watch the film it was really hot. So much so that I wanted the movie to be done as soon as possible because I remember being miserable in the hot room.
Now onto the movie I never read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I even heard of this movie until I saw it in theaters.
So the film does have a good cast of actors and they did perform very well in the movie. The plot from what I can tell follows the events of the book and the characters seem to have follow the same way as they are in the book
There are some cool effects in the film that make you go wow but a few that only fans would understand
Music in the film matches the movie and it works to help telling the story.
It just the film to me was a bit confusing and didn't make a fan out of me. It just some of the scenes in the movie leave me scratching my head so this film would only be more for the fans of Harry Porter while it does something for someone who enjoy this series of movies it just one of those love/hate ordeals

I was one of the thousands of teenagers who wanted to watch this movie so badly and I watched it in the first week it came here in Brazil. After 4 Harry Potter's movies, now I feel comfortable to say that the first movie is the one I liked the least. Maybe because it is the one who has less adventure or danger of all, but I cannot say exactly why. I think it will be very difficult for me, being crazy for Harry Potter's books, to give 10 in any of the H.P.'s movies, since the book is SO MUCH better than any of the films.

Although it is better for kids and was better at time it was released and at times when pc game and books was released, and is best for those who previously read books or played games, it is not a disappointment for adults or people who hear for it for the first time, even if late. There is so much stuff why this is enjoyable. Magic, adventure, emotions, relationships, comparison and analogous to real world, and associative with religion. For example it reminded me of religious history and explanations of various invisible worlds that our eye can't see, and which is presented in this movie better than in any religious book probably. Exciting realistic and graphics are the most realistic and best. Even newest movies in 2020 are not comparable by so ralistic graphics to this one.",14-May-20,10,0,

Fully realized world. But does contain some flawed cgi.,PatrynXX,"Now I'm not the sort of hateful guy that looks at such a movie and cries foul. I suppose if the Catholics can have corrupted priests... us Christians can have Nazi supported book burnings. What.. are we paranoid of this? Lemme guess.. they're gonna go apeskip over Halloween.
I like magic. Kinda wish the Death Gate Cycle was made into a movie. (hence my email address name) But I'm afraid that'll be rated R. Imagine Merlin without his magic? Are we so concerned about our children that we deny them the right to read?
I've never truly been into Harry Potter. But I have been interested. I love to read books. Though I'm in a bit of a lull at the moment. But anyone who can get the young ones to read an 800 page book definatly gets my attention. I wasn't sure about watching the movie until a certain fool decided it was book burning time. These of course are the same folks who advocate murdering abortion doctors. Which is worse? Reading about fantasy or actually committing the act?
Well enough political crap. I loved the movie. It was very well done. While I've never read a book, this had amazing use of CGI. However.. some of the fight scenes looked very fake. And I found it funny that a 152 minute movie made use of it's time so wisely. I didn't find anything boring about it. It's a movie that I think any age would love. (unless your one of those unmentionables above.. I never thought it was our right at Christians to hate and judge people. But I guess thats what happens sometimes.) At this rate I'm bound to find a copy of that trailer coming out this friday. :)

A Very Nice Effort,lambiepie-2,"Okay, I never read the Harry Potter Books. I couldn't have cared less, but I have nieces and nephews and other children in my life who are from ages 7 to 12 who have. What I had to do was remember what it was like when I was that age, so long ago, and what ""new"" movies I had to entertain myself with.
So...I had ""Oliver!"", ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang! Bang!"". Other than those, it was ""R"" rated films that I was more interested in. Why? For that is what interested me via what Hollywood made available. I was ""too old"" for those cutie Disney Animated cartoons of that time, and too young for the adult theme films that were being advertised which I DID want to see. This is why I like this film, it brings back the genre for children, the wonder, the fantasy in film just for them.
A nice effort production wise, with the casting, with the story. Children love fantasy, wonder, adventure, a character THEIR age doing and thinking like THEY would and...watching kids eat lots of ""sweets"". This Harry Potter film fit the bill.
For me as an adult, it was...nice. For children between 7 and 12, its fantastic. The special effects were neat, the story was engaging for them, but what I liked the best was the school itself. I thought that the classes and interactions of the children with each other were on their level. So it was at a Wizards school. Point is, it could be at ANY school. (or boarding school!)
In my surroundings, there have been a few adults/parents screaming about how this film and the school ""Hogwarts"" promotes kids to get into the black arts. I think that is so awful to think that, and I think it does not give children the benefit of the doubt. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a nice little film about something a child/pre-teen has fun with. I actually compared it to the Disney film ""Fantasia"" and the scene of Mickey being the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"". I watched that over and over as a 6 year old and trust me, I had no desire to get into ""the black arts"".
To me, this film is geared towards that audience that has been forgotten AND portrayed in the last 15 years, the 7 to 12 year olds. Yes, Disney had alot of animation that was marketed to that group of children, but its been quite sometime to make a long full length feature film of fantasy where children are the focus, and they are just...children. Reminds me of ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang""...fantasy films for the 7 to 12 year old to enjoy the movie going experience on their level, but NOT talking DOWN to them.
Children under 7 may be a bit scared at some parts and teens over 13 may not get into this film at all. But for the 7 to 12 year olds, this film is a nice one for them in the same vein as ""Oliver!"" and ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was for me.",28 November 2002,10,,

"A film visually full of colors and very entertaining for the whole family, with a lot of humor, adventure, mystery, thriller and full of lessons in friendship and moral",fernandoschiavi,"It all started in 1990 when J.K.Rowling had the idea about a boy with glasses and black hair, it popped into his head during a train ride from Manchester to London. She has since gone on to work on her first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and on a plan that included the plots of each of the seven books she planned to release. In the years that followed Rowling had her daughter, divorced her first husband and moved to Portugal, always continuing to write the book. Finally, in 1996, the book was ready, and after eight publishers rejected the manuscript, Bloomsbury agreed to publish it the following year. After its publication, the Harry Potter series gained great popularity and commercial success worldwide and gave rise to films, video games, among others. The great merit of J.K. Rowling that led the series to be so popular with young people is the construction of an intensely pleasant hero and puts his adventures on paper by mixing great dark adventures with light drama and pleasant comedy. It is this same essence and tone that director Chris Columbus employs in this first adventure of the wizard boy, and he does it very well. Usually fans of some work adapted to the cinemas always end up complaining about omitted facts. But this is not the case. Steve Kloves' script is incredibly faithful to Rowling's book. All the remarkable passages for the readers are present and finally manage to cease the curiosity of how everything would be. Steve Kloves' script is the result of meticulous work and should have been nominated for several awards as the best script adapted to that year's Oscar. It keeps all the main passages in the book and many of the characters' speeches come straight from the pages of the book to the mouths of their interpreters. Most of the changes mentioned are natural in adaptations from one medium to another, but what gives the clear feeling that the film is just a clipping of the book's events to the screens giving the feeling of being an episodic film is the plot involving Nicolau Flamel , of essential importance to the drama, and which is mentioned only in the final part of the film, somewhat out of obligation so that all passages of the climax were justified. On the other hand, it should be noted that this first film is about introducing the complex universe of the series to the public. For this reason, Columbus loses the necessary time to introduce the protagonist to the audience (his past history, who he is, how he lives) and the personality characteristics of dozens of other characters, in addition to having to mention several terms and an infinity of scenarios from the wizarding world that the audience gets to know along with Harry throughout the scenes. It is a film that pleases by its ability to be faithful to the book and to consolidate the fundamental bases for films released in the future. For this reason, we have to see Harry still at the Dursleys' house to get to know them better and to know what life was like for the young wizard with his uncles and to give us a sense of the powers that were then unknown to Harry, such as his ability to communicate with snakes. Only afterwards are we introduced to the gigantic and expansive settings at Hogwarts, and then meet the teachers and the various classes they teach. Then we watch Harry and his friends develop over a whole year at school until he can face his first big challenge at the end of the school year (even several of the final challenges use the knowledge they learn in class). The unknown cast of children proved to be the right choice and that was fundamental, since the expectation of success of the film and the permission for the development of the following films was enormous. If a casting choice was wrong, we would have to live with it until the end of the saga. Emma Watson is the perfect Hermione Granger, the little witch daughter of parents who are not wizards and who is extremely studious and smart, and certainly the most intelligent for her age. Who knew that girl would be in the future one of the best actresses and one of the most beautiful of her generation. Rupert Grint also proved to be the best choice to be Ron Weasley. The young actor with natural red hair is one of those who best embodies the character and his clumsy, comical and friendly way. His facial expressions are also priceless. Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest in performance of the main trio, precisely the great protagonist. But even so, his work is very satisfying and only gets better throughout the series. The chemistry of this trio on the scene made them a reference and the success of the features made them three of the richest young people in the world. We also have other highlights like Harry Melling as Duda Dursley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Matthew Lewis as the clumsy and priceless Neville Longbottom.
In addition to the respected cast and praise for the script's fidelity, the technical part of Harry Potter is his great strength. Stuart Craig's art direction is such a masterpiece that he was nominated for an Oscar, competing even with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but losing to Moulin Rouge - Love in Red. The work is stunning. The scenarios reproduced accurately create the world of JK Rowling, from the magical Beco Diagonal, the wizard bank Gringotes, the store of Mr. Olivaras, platform number 9 and ¾ that serves as a gateway to the world of wizards, the representation from the Quidditch game, the Forbidden Forest, and Hogwarts' diverse and diverse settings (especially the Great Hall, the constantly moving stairs and the moving pictures) reproducing all the grandeur and grandeur of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The costume, also nominated for an Oscar, being surpassed again by Moulin Rouge, is impeccable. Students' Hogwarts uniforms, teachers', Hagrid's, elves', janitor Mr. Filch's clothes, and the Quidditch outfit and ""ordinary"" clothes in which the characters are not in school uniforms, are a glimpse into the eyes and reflect very well the personality of each of the characters. The soundtrack was under the responsibility of John Williams, a regular contributor to Steven Spielberg's films, such as Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Jurassic Park (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). His theme song, once again, has become classic and timeless.
The visual effects are the weak point of the film and if they were better produced they would make the film technically perfect, especially in the same year that we see the spectacular effects of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, deservedly winner of the Oscar in the category in 2002. Due to the short space between the end of filming and the release of the film, several special effects companies worked on the film, with Industrial Light & Magic creating the face of Voldemort in Quirrell's head, Rhythm & Hues animating the dragon Norberto and Sony Pictures Imageworks creating Quidditch. Even working well at the time and being efficient, they show that they have aged badly in a short time. The main animations are of a lower quality than expected, such as Trasgo, the centaur Firenze and the Three-headed Dog that protects the entrance to the place where the Philosopher's Stone is located. The Quidditch game has a very artificial result, from the game itself to the scenarios inserted in the background by computer.
Chris Columbus received criticism for just driving in a bureaucratic way, transposing everything faithfully to the screens, without taking any greater risks. Some sequences could have a better result, such as the challenges faced to reach the Philosopher's Stone, and Harry's first encounter with the One-Who-Cannot-Be-Named who had everything to be darker, but which ended up becoming monotonous and without great emotions. On the other hand, the Quidditch scenes take place at a breakneck and exciting pace even with the less convincing effects.
The end result is an attractive film visually full of colors and very entertaining for the whole family, with a lot of humor, adventure, mystery, suspense, with magical and fun scenes, and full of lessons in friendship and morals. This first part has a lighter air and serves well to introduce everyone to that new world and to outline and define the personality of the characters for the next films. A milestone in modern fantasy cinema that was the beginning of a series that would win children, teenagers and adults and make billions of dollars at the box office over eight very successful films.",31 December 2020,8,,
"An adventure for all ages, still a masterpiece",Holt344,"Harry Potter is something that I grew up with, movies, games and the novels but I've only read the first two. These movies for me are masterpieces of its genre, it was just great in every aspect. Some things like the special effects, visuals and sets were groundbreaking back in 2001 and it still holds up today except that I can sadly tell that it's CGI at times but I didn't mind it at all. It still has the same heart, the characters are still great, intriguing, funny and well cast. I almost remembered every single scene except for a couple minor ones, I have watched these movies so many times and I still find them enjoyable, even as an adult. Today I noticed that the movie got nominated to 3 Oscars and they were right to get nominations, the music and soundtrack by John Williams should have won as it is something unique and perfect, one of my all time favorite movie soundtracks as it just flows so well with the movie.
The characters are incredible and the actors playing them is also incredible, being a child actor must be hard at times but it seems they grew up fine with being one of the most known children and teenagers on the movie screen, they did good work with portraying their characters and actually making it realistic with the bullying and such. That was something I never paid attention to before but now, the children were really bullying Hermione. She is probably my favorite of the three main characters but all three are as good, they have different flaws and unique traits and personalities that makes you fall in love with them.",16 January 2019,10,,
I outgrew this film and its source material when I was a fetus,mentalcritic,"My sister, bless her heart, used to work in a bookstore, and brought the novel this turkey is based upon home one day. After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives.
So when I was given the chance to see this film for free, as long as I delivered my considered opinion to the local distributor when it was all over, I knew I should have let someone else take the assignment. But I just couldn't let fate smack me in the face once without giving it a chance to even out the marks. I basically had a similar reaction to the film that I did to the book: I walked out on it in about thirty minutes. As for what I told the local distributor, it runs something along the lines of missing the book's feeble, so-obvious-it-will-make-you-shake-your-head-in-despair attempts at satire and not being all that well-acted to boot. It is nothing more than a 152-minute commercial for a bunch of merchandise that is basically useless and prone to falling apart, but it does have Harry's visage on it.
Since this film has been released in Australia, there has been constant comparisons between it and the upcoming Lord Of The Rings adaptations. There is no comparison for the following reasons: LOTR treats its audiences with respect, LOTR treats the faiths, cultures, and peoples it takes a lot of its details from with respect, and LOTR is not aimed at the lowest possible common denominator. Now that I have that out of the way, I'll just sit back and bask in my superiority to HP fans until the local distributor gets around to releasing LOTR this boxing day. :P",24 December 2001,1,,
The magic begins!,vip_ebriega,"My Take: It's every bit a new pop-culture classic. An astounding, magical adventure.
Unless you've been living under a rock all your life, you'll know that J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" book series is the biggest thing in the fantasy genre since George Lucas dominated it with STAR WARS. I myself have taken fancy of it, and since I'm a teenager and a big fan of the world Rowling has created, I deeply understand the hype behind it all. The series is very creative with its neat ideas and unique storytelling. The movies, since they were immensely faithful to their source, are just as creative. The series reminded me of the worlds in STAR WARS, since this one takes us away from the bounds of an expensive big-screen movie and transports us to a world unlike reality.
I haven't fully read the first novel THE SORCERER'S STONE, which also became the first of many more adaptations of Rowling's other novels. I only read one so far, and it was THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which would also later be adapted to the screen, and also my favorite of the bunch so far. Even if you haven't read the novel, the movie is a dazzling array of magical images and stylish storytelling. The surprises and twists aren't all that special, but what is special is what's important. This big-screen adaptation is filled with the best kind of special effects George Lucas' ILM effects house has to offer. It's an eye-feast of spellbinding proportions.
I really don't need to dictate what the film is about. If you've been living under a rock and you don't know what it's about, I suggest you just read the book instead. Its deliverance from the book to the movie is not much different. But that's all right, the acting and production values are par excellence. The acting by a veteran cast are terrific, but its the younger cast players that dazzle more. The acting skills of a then-young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who have then grown into the roles) are terrific, with Watson being the best (her Ms. Know-it-all impression is a stand-out). Supporting performances are provided by a line of ""who's who"" like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and a few others including a host of top British talents that would soon be a staple in the series along with its special effects and astounding sets.
I don't have to say this, but here it goes, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE is magical.

"World building, but excessively boring",educallejero,"At times, it seems the only objective the director has is presenting ""Harry Potter magical things"" one after the other and that's it. There is no story. The movie is nothing, really. It expects us to be amazed by the score. And the score is great, but no. It doesn't work. And that's more than an hour.
After that, it gets better when the adventure and plot actually starts. There is a sense of pace at least. The scenes are not always as exciting as they could be, but overall it's well done. The kids are good for their age. The second part of the movie is childish by choice and it works.

A fun introduction,Movi3DO,"WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!
Since the whole Harry Potter movie series got added to HBO Max for a limited time, I'm going to watch all of them, and this is the first one.
This was an enjoyable introduction into the magical universe. The script used the long run-time well and showed many creative ideas that had me smiling and amazed. The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time.
The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now.
Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much.
Overall, an entertaining and fun movie. Go Gryffindor! 7.5/10.",12 June 2021,7,,

Harry potter as Seeker or khoji wins my opinion. The reason is in spite of wearing spectacles he is assigned such a position. I simply like that.
Home is another point where my opinion is that harry could have been located at a better place. A place where he is respected may be with Hagrid. The life could have been made less troublesome.

The Magic Comes To Life!,jhclues,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born: A boy. A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world. And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves. Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard. But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was. It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard. When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born: The gift of magic! And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.
What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life. And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job. More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special. The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end. From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter. And it's magic.
Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part. And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here. Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it. A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.
Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione. As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect. Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing. And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.
It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.
The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch). From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone. A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages. A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.",21 November 2001,10,,
The Best of The Bunch,PartialMovieViewer,,17 July 2014,10,,
Fine reminder of where the magic all began,Stampsfightclub,"Raised by a family who detests him, Harry Potter (Radcliffe) learns he is a wizard and soon finds himself at school of magic Hogwarts.
It's hard to imagine in the 90's J.K Rowling being rejected a contract for her wizard series. The Harry Potter franchise has spun further than many anticipated and this film reminds us of the moment when the franchise really took off and some magic really happened.
Almost 8 years ago now and current renowned teen stars Radcliffe, Watson and Grint star in their first roles as the famous friends Harry, Hermione and Ron, all with a magical gift. So the acting is far from perfect, it hardly matters now when you watch the series as the actors learn from their mistakes and we see them growing up and facing more challenging tests, for their characters and for themselves.
It is however the older actors who generate the magic of acting. Alan Rickman was born to play Snape whilst Richard Harris fits the role of Dumbledore like a glove.
But this is all about the story of a young unappreciated boy who was born in a different lifetime from his adoptive parents the Dursleys. Struggling under the strain of life Harry is thrown a lifeline when he arrives at Hogwarts, a chance to make friends and live life as he wants. This is an entertaining 2 hour picture that generates laughs, mystery and excitement in the form of a different world. The concept of magic is always tricky to cover in terms of realism but J.K Rowling's imagination is frequently present here and is adapted with some gusto in this 2001 fantasy adventure.
However where this film offers spills and thrills consistently there is so much missing from the book. More imagination and excitement appears on the pages where we see more characters are introduced. Therefore it is worth reading before viewing, s with all the instalments.
John Williams' score fits the scene perfectly whereas Chris Columbus' direction is good, you can't but feel the elements of magic could have been justified to generate a bit more surprise. Nevertheless the Quidditch match is some of the finest sporting direction you will ever see in the franchise.
This first part is a humorous and enthralling family adventure that does enough good justice to the book and with some good performances is a fine reminder of where the young stars started and where the franchise really begun.",6 March 2009,8,,
I can see why the kids like it.,CharltonBoy,My review of this film may be a little blinded by the fact that i hate kids films but that apart i can see why kids would like this film. The story is very good as are the special affects and there is a very good cast of actors. The shame is that the lead star is the poorest of all the actors including all the other child actors. It's ok to have the Harry Potter look but it does help have the acting abilty too and i'm afraid Daniel Radcliffe does not have it. Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris are superb . I have not seen read the book (im one of the few!)so i have an unbiased point regarding the comparison but i can see how the book would have some appeal if it is anything like the film. All in all not bad but not my cup of tea. 7 out of 10.,4 June 2002,7,0,
"Great for Kids, Less So for Adults",gbheron,"Everyone knows that technically this movie is top notch. Special effects, acting, directing; the whole package is as good as it gets. The team has accurately brought the best selling children's fantasy book to the screen, delighting children and earning themselves bank-loads of money.
That's great for kids and the studios, but what about adults? Actually, there's not very much at offer. Chris Columbus and Ms Rowling seem stretched pretty thin story-wise in this first installment of Harry Potter. Quidditch? The chess game? Learning to ride a broomstick? Big Deal. It doesn't seem new and not even on par with a Star Trek installment. It more resembles Disney's early 60s efforts like Herbie the Love Bug. Ok, so Harry's supposed to be in about the fifth grade or so. When he ages will the stories get more mature also? No, they won't. Four, five, six more Harry Potter films? Not for me, one or two will probably suffice.",3 February 2002,8,0,
True Magic,jon.h.ochiai,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful movie. This comes from a Harry Potter illiterate. The story and movie are very reminiscent of the Star Wars mythology. Orphan Harry has special gifts-- an undeveloped and natural power. He like Luke Skywalker is the chosen One. So he must be trained. In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive ""dark side"" to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, ""...forgetting to live."" Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents. Also the message that true magic does not come from books, rather from friendship, bravery, and ultimately love is touching. The movie is a magical journey of a hero, Harry.
The movie is stunning visually. The John William's music and sound set the right atmosphere. I gather that director Chris Columbus steered by the R.K. Rowling's book (from the Steven Kloves screenplay). To his credit he generates strong performances from his actors. Daniel Radcliffe (who looks like John Lennon as a boy) is perfect as Harry-- the lonely and courageous boy coming into his own, and finding and creating a family. Emma Watson as know-it-all, Hermione, all but steals the movie. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is charming and funny. Robbie Coltrane is great as the protector Hagrid. Alan Rickman is at his slippery evil best as Prof. Snape. An unusually restrained Richard Harris is excellent as the Headmaster Dumbledore, the powerful, wise, and whacky mentor. Maggie Smith as Headmistress McGonagall is great as the strict and compassionate professor. As one of my friends says-- ""Maggie Smith rocks!""
""Harry Potter"" is total entertainment. I will read the book.",21 November 2001,9,,
Better Than Anticipated,Hollywood_Yoda,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong?
J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.
A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema.",14 August 2016,8,9,
This is some above average stuff here...,DarthBill,"Initially I was against this series because the kids leave such huge messes at the cinema where I work. Then I decided to rent the first movie and give it a look to see what it is the kids love about it so much. Then it hit me: it's the story of a no talent underdog who overcomes great obstacles with a little help from his friends. And who doesn't like that?
Overall, I'd say this is above average. I thought the three kids, Radcliffe (Harry), Grint (Ron), and Watson (Hermione), gave capable performances, oh, as did Felton, who played Draco. Also worthy of mention are Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. If this film has any failing it may be that they try too hard to remind us of Harry's importance (he IS important, but isn't that obvious from the fact that he's the title character?).
So give it a rental. 7/10",17 March 2003,2,3,
Magical at (almost) every level,stamper,"First of all I feel obligated to tell all of you, that I'd never read a book or even heard something of Harry Potter, before I went to see this film. All I knew was, that he is a wizard who goes to a wizard school and has adventures there. I picked that much up from the hype that has become Harry Potter since the first book was published.
On to the movie. I must say that despite the many followers of the Harry Potter hype, including the millions that have read the book or seen the film, I kept sceptical about whether I'd like this film. I mean I am almost 21 years old, so maybe it would be too childish for me, who knows? But it was not. It was just as childish as I like it. Christopher Columbus has really outdone himself here. I mean he's made a couple of good films, but this comeback (after the pretty solid Stepmom and the box  office loser Bicentennial Man) really makes this effort stand out so much more.
It is however not only Chris Columbus' quality that made this film what it is. Much of the praise has to go to the writer Mrs. Rowling and to the actors and actresses. I could go on and on about the fact that every actor was good, but what really was astonishing in my mind is, that all children actors and actresses were so good. I mean they were GREAT. They are in my mind even better than the grown ups, because this movie is about the kids, not the adults. The four main wannabe' wizards, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy (who does not only have a name that reminds one of Count Dracula, but looks like a version of him as well), all give you the feeling that many things are yet to come and that many things will happen between them. I mean I am no psychic, but I'd say that someday that little count Dracula will become Harry Potter's opponent and that maybe one day (if they get old enough in the stories) Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter might become more than friends although I'm not sure of that. Maybe I've just seen the Star Wars films too often. If I have, it does not matter anyway, for the cast and crew of this film have watched them too often as well. One part of the music clearly is like Star Wars, there is a hat with a Yoda  like speech pattern plus the teachers want to keep Harry Potter away from the dark side of the force, oh sorry MAGIC!' Come on!!! They've seen Star Wars and learned from it! Not that it bothers me, on the contrary! I am quite pleased to see that people are able to see and pick out something good and insert it into their own work either as an homage or simply because it appeals to them.
There were few things bad in this film. Actually it was only one thing. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Where the heck did Warner Bros. get those guys? I mean one time they create world class effects and then the next you can easily spot the blue screen from miles! It was not as bad that it ruined my experience of the film, but be honest, in a film of this magnitude, you can expect good Effects throughout (see The Lord of The Rings: The fellowship of the Ring or Artificial Intelligence). The effects really were a let down for me at times, but maybe they just overdid it. There were times, in my opinion, that a blue screen would not have even been necessary. Those were also some of the times you could tell the landscape was projected onto a blue screen. Better luck next time.
After the huge success of this film (and even if the success had been more moderate) there will be a number of sequels. Actually two more films are already planned (set for release in 2002 and 2004) and it is believed, that if Mrs. Rowling writes all seven books (as she intended to do), there will be seven films made in total. There are a few things I would like to say to Warner Bros. in regard to those films. First of all, make sure that you will have all original actors necessary for the sequels under contract and if not so persuade them with lots of money. Do not, I repeat DO NOT hire other actors to play characters already portrayed by someone else. Second, hold on to your screenwriter. He has been successful so far in doing what he does. Third, hold on to the man that composed the music. In a franchise you want to keep the music the same throughout all films. If possible even to make the music so memorable, that it makes people say: That the music from Harry Potter.' Fourth and last, hold on to your director (at least for the next one or two sequels, preferably for all if he is up to it). He has worked with all those kids before and knows how to talk to them and how to make them perform well. Plus this is not some Mission: Impossible or James Bond like franchise in which you want every movie to stand on his own. It is supposed to be more of an Indiana Jones kind of franchise. If you do, however change your director, may I suggest that you do is as George Lucas did with the original Star Wars trilogy. Get basically unknown directors, who know their way around a studio and get them to make the film, how you want it to be done. Approaching a director switch like that, will allow all films to fit into the big picture, without inconsistent film styles ruining it.
A good film for the whole family, but just as The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the Ring, it falls short to be best film of the year.

A poor start to the series,Ruskington,"While the series improves as it progress, I found the first two instalments of the Harry Potter franchise quite unenjoyable. Rowling relies heavily on plot band-aids to cover up her mediocre writing and I really cannot think of a more overrated author. I don't even know where to begin regarding the logistical errors of Rowling's work in this particular story. The nonsensical Quidditch scoring system, the abusive Dursleys, Harry's entirely inherited magical abilities, the ridiculous house points scoring system (the ending is just a joke, if I was in Slytherin I would have rioted). These are all bad enough, but it's the overall lack of a cohesive plot that really makes this story so weak. There is no real reason why anything happens, it's merely just a string of random events designed to make the main characters look heroic while the adults gush over them from afar.
The casting choices are highly satisfactory at least, particularly Robbie Coltrane and Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe, however, is very weak in this first instalment- his wooden acting and excessive cutesiness become tiring very quickly.
The special effects are no better, especially considering the budget. The troll is simply laughable, the depiction of Voldemort is atrocious and the flying sequences and Quidditch match are like scenes from a daytime children's TV show. I'm not sure how a 21st century film of this magnitude can contain such uninspiring animations. The sets are very good and I do feel like they bought Hogwarts to life quite accurately, but everything falls apart as soon as any CGI is used.
On top of all these criticisms, the film is just way too long. I appreciate the attempt to tell the story comprehensively, but it's very difficult to consume this movie in one sitting, especially for children. Certain scenes could easily have been shortened or excluded without damaging the story in any way.",14 April 2020,4,,

Overall a fine expirience.,Animany94,"I decided to do a check-up on Harry Potter's famous adventure made for the big screen, so I started reading the books yet again, because I know that changes have been made to make it fit for a visual medium. I knew I would prefer the book, because I'll admit that some scenes that were cut didn't make sense to me.
But I could go on talking only about that, so therefore I'll bring up the good stuff.
The music was beautiful and really captured the sense of wonder when all the magical elements were presented. And the Hogwarts castle was stunning in its grandiosity and still struck me with awe and amazement. The broomstick flying hasn't aged too well as you can tell that they're not really flying when they come in for close-ups, but you can't really blame a movie for being made when it is and the Quidditch game still looked good and felt exciting.
Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Severus Snape and Hagrid respectively were well chosen for the roles and as far as I know, J.K. Rowling had a personal say in their assignments to the roles and it payed off in my opinion. Rickman's soft voice was just what I heard in my head when reading his lines in the books and Coltrane puts just as much likability into Hagrid as I remembered.
Richard Harris and Maggie Smith as Dumbledore and Mcgonagall respectively also did well adding personality and face to those characters. And Rupert Grint stood out as a funny Ron Weasley among our main charcaters. As it is their first meeting with each other, they have to warm up to each other's company, so I Harry is mostly going around being all ""wow, it's amazing, I didn't know that"" but comes around and discovers thing he is not supposed to and getting into trouble as the movie goes on. Hermione is a know-it-all and Malfoy is an arrogant dick. It's a first movie in a coming-of-age story, so that is to be expected.
But I was disappointed with one thing especially, just to round off the faithfulness to the book, because Hermione's character was surprisingly down-played in a couple of crucial areas making up her character growth in the book some of them also could have made a couple of exciting scenes. That made her a little more one-dimensional here, I'll admit.
While some crucial scenes didn't make it, the movie is still good-looking and with some really good choises made for other characters. Add in some fantastic music and you have a fantasy film for the whole family.",22 November 2019,7,,
It's only fair to say that it's truly magical!,Sir_AmirSyarif,"Chris Columbus' 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is the first in the 'Harry Potter' series, and it does an excellent job of introducing the franchise. It's packed with visual magnificence, heroic protagonists, outstanding special effects, and lovable characters. John Williams works his magic, creating music that is almost as recognizable as his 'Star Wars' score. It's only fair to say that it's truly magical!
The finest element of the film, though, is the amazing chemistry between the three young leads: Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson.

Potter on film,ja_kitty_71,"This film is what got into Harry Potter. After I had seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, I had read the original novel and the rest of the series. I know that is a bit unorthodox, but that's me.
As some of you know, Harry was an 11-year old, who had lived with his mean aunt and uncle and bratty cousin. He had no idea of what had happened to his parents. The Dursleys had always told him they had died in a car crash. Yes, it was a miserable life of Harry; until he had received a letter that will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also found that he is wizard, and that his mom and dad were killed by Voldemort, an evil wizard so evil that every witch and wizard is afraid to speak his name. But Voldemort had failed to kill little Harry, so he had left a lightning-shaped scar on his forehand. Thus Harry became ""The Boy Who Lived."" So Harry is taken to Hogwarts, and there he meets the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid; fellow classmates Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. I know I would say this, but that is all I will tell you about the film, folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. As I said many times, I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love ""The Philosopher's Stone"" from beginning to end.

"With spectacular visuals, likeable characters, and a sense of magic and wonder, The Sorcerer's Stone is still a good first entry after 20 years",gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"During my childhood, the earlier Harry Potter books got me into the franchise and especially Fantasy Literature in general. They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building. Then I saw this movie adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone (The Philosopher's Stone in the UK) back in theaters and loved it. It's not a perfect film I'll admit, but it's a very good start to a successful fantasy movie franchise.
Sure, it's a bit overlong and the child performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, while not terrible by any means, could have used some fixing though they did get better as the later movies progressed.
Everything else still holds up. The visual effects/cinematography are beautiful to look at, the directing from Chris Columbus is great, the make up designs are well built, and the music score from John Williams is enchanting and haunting especially Hedwig's Theme. Not to mention the supporting actors are great with Robbie Coltrane as Harris and the late actors Alan Rickman and Richard Harris as Severus Snape and Professor Dumbledore.

Solid Start to the Franchise,Prichards12345,"Having just reviewed Order of The Phoenix I thought I'd better add a few comments about the previous movies. Each time I see a new Harry Potter film I'm tempted to say ""Gosh, how they've grown""! It seems a long time ago now that the first in the series appeared.
And a recent viewing confirms what I've always thought about this film; the casting couldn't have been better. The young leads, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are fine, and a wonderful ensemble of actors lend enjoyable support. Could you imagine anyone other than Robbie Coltrane playing Hagrid? Alan Rickman is also perfectly cast as Professor Snape. And I haven't even mentioned Richard Harris and Maggie Smith yet! It's a huge shame Harris is no longer with us to appear in the series; Michael Gambon gives a different interpretation to Dumbledore, and frankly I don't think he's nailed the role as well as Harris. I've yet to see Maggie Smith give a bad performance. This film is no exception.
I'm not going to discuss the plot - it's too well known to need comment, but there are some narrative problems with the film. It's a little unfocused for much of it's length, but this can be forgiven as it has to set the scene and balance the story for the audience members unfamiliar with the book. The effects are nicely done and John Williams' main theme grows on you. I didn't care much for his score when the film came out but will cheerfully admit to being in error. It isn't his best work but is still of a very high standard indeed. The effects are also fine - I particularly liked Firenze. Yeah, it's all CGI but it suits the tone of the material.
One has to say the film is a little bland; the studio obviously did not want to take too many risks with the book's legion of fans, but it does it job - to entertain and set things up for the following films. Chris Columbus directs adequately but without adding any real flavour to things.
All things considered: a respectable and solid start to the series.",25 July 2007,6,,

A Love-Letter to Fantasy Fans,zac-04879,"Even compared to the majority of fantasy films, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone takes the magical powers and fantastical creatures way too far. It's just like the Harry Potter book series written by J. K. Rowling, except Chris Columbus has brought the words and magic to the screen.
It's easy to say that only those who read and enjoyed the book will adore the film. That's definitely true, but you have to seriously be engaged with these sorts of forgettable fantasy tales to take delight in either. Coming from the perspective of one who dislikes over-the-top fantasy features like Harry Potter, The Philosopher's Stone is flat, boring and extremely fantastical.
If you hate fantasy adventures or these Harry Potter stories, skip the first movie; it's uninteresting and boring. Obviously what's left is how welly-designed all the magic and creatures were, in addition to the costumes and average performances. Some will watch it for Daniel Radcliffe, or the story, or both, but avoid The Philosopher's Stone especially if you can't sit through fantasy tales.

Greatly entertaining!,grahamsj3,"This is a great yarn put together very nicely on film. I think this and the second film are both excellent entertainment. They are wonderful family films although not for very small children. Any child over 8 shouldn't have any problem with these films. The acting is first rate, even by the children. Special effects are, for the most part, very well done. Somehow Fluffy just didn't seem quite real, but that didn't bother me at all. The flying scenes are wonderful. I'm waiting for the 3rd film to come out soon! Good stuff!",18 January 2004,8,0,
Pretty close to the book.,deatman9,"I remember growing up and I loved the Harry Potter books I have read them all. This was a pretty good movie it was pretty close to the book but even with a two and half hour runtime it still leaves out many things and thats why the book is much better. The acting in these older ones is pretty bad too seeing how they were just child no name actors back then.
This movie is about a young boy named harry potter. He lives with his abusive aunt and uncle and one day gets a letter from a place called Hogwarts. The note explains he is actually a wizard and he is invited to go to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizards.
This movie was pretty good but it was probably one of the worst of the bunch. The acting and special effects were pretty poor and they left too much stuff out of the book stick to the books people",7 November 2012,6,0,
The Potter movie that started it all.,mikayakatnt,"Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.
This film is an introduction to the cultural phenomenon surrounding the Harry Potter universe. With book-to-movie adaptations, there are many things that can go astray. Yet Philosopher's Stone seems to capture the wonderment and childhood terror that makes the series a cross-generational classic.
Also kudos to the actors. Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, et al. gave a stellar performance that charms audiences around the world.
It's a charming firm, lighthearted, and whimsical. There's a ton of world-building that lets audiences' imaginations run wild. The film itself is an impressive watch. Even if the CGI seems a bit dated at some places... but is that a fair critique for a 19 y/o film?
Personally, one complaint I had was how fast time seemed to move in this film. We move from month to month rather disorientingly. But you try compressing a school year in a single 2-hour movie.
The other complaint was based on how things seemed to happen too perfectly for Harry. But I understand that is the book's fault & not the movie's.
3.5/5. Great to watch with family and friends.",9 April 2020,7,,

Freshman year at Hogwart's passes the grade,oneloveall,"Although the first installment of the Harry Potter series falls slightly short of the all-encompassing magical experience it had hoped to be, one must admit it did come pretty close to a total triumph. Based on the insanely popular children novels from author J.K. Rowling, viewers are entertainingly introduced to the enchanted world of young witchcraft and wizardry which had captivated an inordinate number of readers. 30 minutes into the expensive film and it is completely clear why.
Rowling has crafted an exquisitely, conceptually rich fantasy world which manages to combine many darker, reality-based themes and deal with them through the wondrous world of Hogwarts. It is in this immensely beguiling school a majority of the entire franchise will take place, and it is easy to see why. A new vernacular with which Rowling describes her alternate universe seemed to have resonated with many more people then expected, and in this satisfying introduction director Chris Columbus wastes hardly any time getting into the fun of it all. Not since the mid 80's have we seen such a lovingly detailed homage to children's fantasies, labored over in such a way that would make any hardened fan of the genre blush.
Brought to life by a great cast, many experienced actors playing professors of the magic school only make these young trio of children, whom we will come to watch mature, that much more engaging. Daniel Radcliffe may have been a little over his head with this first installment, arguably overshadowed by his two co-conspirators. He nevertheless accomplishes the task of portraying the iconic shy boy wizard with a little directional and a whole lot of conceptual help, ushering in one of the more lucrative franchises of modern days.",31-May-07,7,,
Real magic! A fantastic magic film!,jdkraus,"Harry Potter was honestly the best picture of the year 2001. It was funny, scary, mysterious, magical, vivid, non-stopped action sequences, magnificent effects, and awesome! The movie rules over the book, for the book was slow moving and got kind of dull for me. The director Christopher Columbus was the right choice for directing the fantasy film, who also directed my family fun films the Home Alone series. Plus, I honestly was not sure what I was reading. However, the only problem with the film was it was hokey in some places, including the troll scene in the girls bathroom. Otherwise it was well done. The second was also equally good, but I have a feeling the third one is going to be a failure to Harry Potter fans.",1 March 2004,8,0,

Rather good fantasy movie.,tomimt,"Note, that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling, so I can't really say how this movie compares with it.
So, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left to grow with his eeeevil aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Griffits). They make harry do all the chores, while they pamper their own son. But Harry is not an ordinary boy: he's a wizard and he's been accepted at wizard school of Hogwarts. So of to school we go. At Hogwarts he and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) find out evil plot of Voldemort, ho wants to steal The Philosophers Stone, so he could get himself a body, him being partly dead and all.
What was surprising, was that even tough the movie is full of child actors, there isn't any highly annoying case among the cast. And there are many other great actors among adults, like Richard Harris as Dumbledore, head teacher of Hogwarts and Robbie Coltrane as friendly giant Hagrid.
Plot is over all very good, mixing fantasy and adventure very well. Visually movie is very good looking, but it does have some wooden looking CGI effects but fortunately they don't effect in the watching pleasure.
Over all very good adaptation from the first part of very popular book series.",28 March 2005,7,,
A Good Start To The Franchise,alindsayal,"So Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is set to hit cinemas next month and I thought this would be the time to go back and watch the films in The Harry Potter franchise, starting with the Philosophers Stone. So I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young child find out he is a wizard and he is enrolled in a school for magic where he tries to learn more about himself.
Main Character A young Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter and he does about as well as a child actor would do in the role. You care about Harry and there is that innocence about him that makes him easy to root for and support in his journey. But there is no denying that his acting ability isn't great, some of the delivery of his lines is cringe and I think this would have always been the case and at least with this film the youth of the character was a hinderance in terms of performance quality.
Supporting Characters The same could be said for Rupert Grint and Emma Watson's first performances as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They have clear characters and they do the best they can, Ron is quite funny and Hermione is smart but sometimes it can't be conveyed well enough because of the inexperience of the performers. The seasoned actors all do great jobs, Maggie Smith is really fun as Professor McGonagall and I like how she is as the teacher and her dynamic with the three kids is handled and Smith seems to be having plenty of fun. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is also really entertaining to watch, he is such a jolly character and he is kind of a mentor to Harry, which is one of my favourite parts of the film. The late Alan Rickman plays Severus Snape and he is just brilliant in the role, he has become iconic and this is the start of his run as the character. Richard Harris plays Dumbledore and honestly he doesn't have lots of screen time but when he does, he is a presence and I really like how they treat him as this ultimate wizard despite having a smaller presence in this film.
Story The story does a really effective job of introducing us to the Wizarding world and getting us to instantly care about our main character and this new world that was created. I really enjoyed seeing the different lessons of Hogwarts and things like Quidditch. But this film does feel a little bit unbalanced, the last act has a reveal that doesn't quite work and I think it just meanders a bit in its storytelling. It has so much to tell us that it sometimes feels like exposition dumps even if it is entertaining.
Script The script is good, there are some pretty funny moments in the film and as I have said a few times I did care about the characters and when they were actually in peril. Don't get me wrong it isn't perfect but I think it does an effective enough job of introducing us to this franchise and the story that will not only be told in this film but plenty of sequels.
Style For a film that came out over 20 years ago the effects are still pretty good and seeing the wizarding on screen is always fun. Also, despite the story being a bit passive, I actually thought it was paced quite well and something interesting was happening on screen.
Overall Overall, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is a good start to the franchise that does the job well of starting this franchise and getting the young actors off to a start.
Rating - 7/10.",7 March 2022,7,,
A Hufflepuff Review,Darkside-Reviewer,"The very first time I saw Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was when I was just ten years old and as an end of year treat my class at school got to see the movie on opening day. I remember being especially excited because our class had just finished reading the book as part of our English literature class so I was already a huge fan of the book and couldn't wait to see the movie.
The Harry Potter series of books are some of the greatest modern works of fiction ever written and will undoubtedly be read by generations of children and adults in the years to come. Myself and countless other people grew up reading the Harry Potter books as they were released but we were also very lucky to experience the Harry Potter movies as they were released seeing the characters we know and love grow up with us along the way leaving us with great memories and experiences and now as adults we get to share this magical world with our children reading them these magical and unique stories that mean so much to us and hopefully to them aswell.
As a child this movie was always one of my favourites and in many ways it still is even as an adult but as adults we view movies differently even the ones we enjoy so much we can't help but laugh at some of the cheesy dialogue or at the outdated effects we used to be in awe of. To be fair this is the first Harry Potter movie so you can easily look past some of the plot holes and cover ups that are more noticeable now that all the books and movies have been released. One of the things I find myself laughing over whenever I watch this movie now is just how much Voldemorts character looks and behaves so much like the Emperor from Star Wars right down to his speech trying to convince Harry Potter to join the dark side but it's forgivable as it was the first movie and Voldemorts character is essentially just a face and a creepy voice in this movie.
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is a very good movie adaptation of the source material and thanks to the help of J.K Rowling and an amazing cast of British actors this movie became an instant hit worldwide with the Harry Potter series becoming a worldwide phenomenon that continues to this day inspiring millions of children and adults in so many ways.
If by some miracle you have never seen a Harry Potter movie or read any of the books I highly recommend giving them a try they are some of the best modern works of fiction out there.",25 August 2020,8,,
"It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)",Movie-12,"HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)
Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?
Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.
With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences.
That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.
""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?
The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not.
After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.
Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen.
Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",18 December 2001,7,,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,auuwws,"Great movie, I really enjoyed watching it, Daniel Radcliffe's acting in the movie was bad but improved with the progress of the movie, Emma Watson's acting in the movie was amazing especially since it was the first movie she acted in, Rupert Grint's acting was excellent, he played his role excellently, the movie was very interesting but I I felt a little bored while watching it. I wish the movie was shorter. I recommend watching the movie and my rating for the movie is 8.5.",22 July 2021,9,0,
Epic Movie of the Century,meydiana-65242,"There's nothing like the first There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.
Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!
Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?
First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie",19 October 2020,10,,
It's hard to choose the best one,Min111,,8 December 2020,10,,
Outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids,FlickJunkie-2,"This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen. After that, its appeal drops off dramatically. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.
Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film. The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books. Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned). That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing. So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.
From a technical perspective the film is marvelous. The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match. The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets. Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.
The acting is fabulous. Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry. He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part. He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type. This is exactly the right balance. Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film. Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous. Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.
The adult actors also represent themselves admirably. Richard Harris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall. Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable. Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position. But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (`I shouldn't have said that. I should NOT have said that.') Coltrane makes Hagrid as lovable as he is bumbling; a kid in a grown-up's body that is clearly on the kids' side.
This is a delightful film for middle school kids, a segment that has fewer film choices than toddlers and teens. I'd rate it a 9/10, shaving a point for excessive workup that slowed down the story a bit. However, for Harry Potter fans, this is a perfect ten.",21 June 2002,9,,

Jon Monsarrat review: generic and boring,johnnymonsarrat,"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great film for kids in the same way that a lot of generic fiction is great for kids. They are too young to know that many of the themes in Harry Potter have been done to death in other fantasy books and (to an extent) movies.
To make it worse, two factors. One, Harry is a bit of an anti-hero because things happen to him rather than he taking the lead. Additionally, bits and pieces of the book are placed in the movie in a way which builds quite a meandering plot for someone who hasn't read the book. The game of air hockey ""quiddich"", and learning to fly the brooms are two examples. The overall theme of the Harry Potter series (as I have been told by friends) is that Harry is a little boy who finds himself, grows up and discovers greatness. That theme is 100% lost in the film.
If you didn't rave over ""LadyHawke"" or ""Labyrinth"", or more recently, ""Final Fantasy"" or ""Jumanji"", you probably won't rave over Harry Potter. Arty types who've been listening to all the hype and considering going should note that the film didn't win any Oscars. Harry Potter is a world apart from Lord of the Rings.
Who should see this film:
-- Fantasy buffs -- I won't be able to dissuade you so I won't try,
but don't bring your SO, instead take him/her to LOTR.
-- Kids and adults with kids who have built up a tolerance
to kid stuff
-- Sci-fi buffs who either love computer graphics or have
nothing better to do on a rainy day.

A wonderful tale of witchcraft and wizardry,FilmFanInTheHouse,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001, Dir. Chris Columbus) Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his 11th birthday, but he is far from wrong. A giant named Hagrid appears, and gives Harry the all important news. He is a wizard. Now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. Here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. Ron Weasley is not very brave friend and Hermione is the smart friend. But not everything is quiet at Hogwarts as Harry suspects someone is planning to steal the philosopher's stone.
I had read the original story of 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', but i never really got into the actual fandom in which it received. I enjoy films over books, so it's only natural that i would enjoy the film a lot. It just plain fun to watch and can be easily enjoyed. All the children do wonderful jobs as the characters, although there were a few scenes which they seemed off, i can let this slide as they are only young. The special effects were good, especially the quidditch scene. There were a few odd shots, where the CGI looked a bit like a video game. This is mainly the troll scene, where it suffers poorly. Alan Rickman is fantastic as Snape, even if he had a short amount of time on film. This movie is a wonderful storytelling of fantasy and was definitely a sign of things to come.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter. - Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)",23 July 2007,7,,
Magical masterpiece,jhaggardjr,"Here is the magical surprise of 2001. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the best movie that I've seen all year (so far). This I totally did not expect. This is a film that works not only on the level of special effects. It has a terrific story, wonderful characters, and a beautiful atmosphere. This was quite refreshing since so many of the movies today that feature special effects are weak on story and characterization. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first movie in what is going to be a big movie series based on ""Harry Potter"" novels written by J.K. Rowling. So far four novels have been written with three more on the way. This movie has created so much hype that the second movie is already in the works. I think this is going to be a blockbuster franchise. The movie opens with the title character living with relatives that are cruel and heartless. Then Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and learns that he's a wizard. So he gets away from his despicable uncle, aunt, and cousin, and journeys to this special school to learn the tricks of his trade. Along the way he meets two young aspiring magicians who will become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes an enemy in Draco Malfoy, who is kind of like the evil version of Harry. The faculty of Hogwarts include wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore; huge groundskeeper Hagrid; Prof. McGonagall, who can transform into a cat and back to human form in a flash; Prof. Snape, who's sinister looks create fear in the students; Prof. Hooch, the broomstick instructor; and Prof. Quirrell, who wears what looks like a turban all the time and studders alot. There are alot of visual elements that work wonderfully in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". My favorite scene is the one where the students play the game of Quidditch. That is a fascinating special effects sequence that is kind of hard to describe but is fulfilling to watch. It kind of reminded me of the pod race in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" with its effects going across the screen at a rapid pace. Another great scene in the movie is the one where the three kids play an unusual high stakes game of chess, where the huge game pieces come to life. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" works on every level. In addition to the excellent special effects, it works on the direction and screenplay. The director here is Chris Columbus, who's worked in this territory before as the director of the popular kids- oriented 1990 comedy ""Home Alone"" and its first sequel, 1992's ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". He worked with kids again in the little more adult oriented 1993 Robin Williams blockbuster ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". These three hit movies directed by Columbus were more lighthearted in its tone, but Columbus has been in more darker territory before. His directorial debut came with ""Adventures in Babysitting"", the black comedy from 1987 that was filmed in Chicago and starred Elisabeth Shue. Before stepping into the director's chair, Columbus wrote a couple of screenplay's for a trio of Steven Spielberg productions: ""Gremlins"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" bares a resemblance to each one of those movies in some way. Those virtuoso special effects scenes when those big chess pieces comes to life was very much like some of the special effects scenes in ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". This movie is like an ""Indiana Jones"" for kids; so was ""The Goonies"". This movie is scary and darker in tone; so was ""Gremlins"". Though unlike ""Gremlins"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" isn't violent. It's scary, but not over-the-line scary. Columbus was a good choice as director of this movie (Steven Spielberg had a chance to direct this, but passed on it to make ""A.I.""), and it's his best film as director to date. He's brought this movie to life in exhilarating fashion. The screenplay is by Oscar nominee Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys""), who did a superb job in adapting the movie from the book. The cinematography, editing, production design, and costume design are all first-rate and deserve Oscar attention, along with the visual effects. The performances are picture perfect. The three kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all acting newcomers and they were all perfect choices to play these characters. I think we'll be seeing alot of Daniel Radcliffe in the future. Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter to absolute perfection. He holds the movie together in every scene, and was a natural choice to play this character. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are very exceptional as Ron and Hermione. Like Radcliffe, we'll be seeing alot of Grint and Watson for years to come. They're all terrific young British actors (and they've all been signed on to star in the next ""Harry Potter"" movie). You couldn't have asked for a better supporting cast than the one that's featured in this movie, all a who's who of veteran British actors. Richard Harris (as headmaster Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), Robbie Coltrane (groudskeeper Hagrid), Zoe Wanamaker (Prof. Hooch), and Ian Hart (Prof. Quirrell) are all perfectly cast; with John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Fiona Shaw, and Julie Walters featured in smaller roles. What a cast! I loved everything about ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This is not just a movie for kids, but for the whole family. I've never read any of the ""Harry Potter"" books, but on the basis of this first ""Harry Potter"" movie, I think I'm going to go out and purchase the books. Or maybe ask to receive them as a Christmas gift. Speaking of Christmas, I think ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be the smash hit of the Christmas season 2001. If it doesn't surpass last year's Christmas hit, ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (which opened at exactly the same time a year ago), then the American moviegoing public has completely lost it. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has gotten far better reviews that ""The Grinch"" movie did last year, and critically acclaimed movies deserve to be blockbuster hits alot more than critically hated movies like ""The Grinch"". From what I saw this weekend (a packed moviehouse and an opening day gross of $29.5 million), ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" will be a blockbuster smash. BET ON IT!!!!!

"Professionally well done, but not exactly my cup of tea...",buiger,"Very professionally made. The sound, camera and especially the Set Decoration where really excellent. Some of the special f/x where a little cheesy though. The story itself is not exactly my cup of tea, I never liked stories with magic and wizards, not even as a kid, so i will refrain from commenting too much on that. Kids love it, and that is what counts in this case. The acting was excellent throughout, with a stellar cast, but also with great performances from the 'kids'.",21 August 2020,7,0,
A good adaptation of Rowling's novel,AKS-6,"It certainly wasn't an easy task Chris Columbus took upon himself when he started working on adapting one of the most loved novels ever for the screen. I have to say that I was among those who felt almost upset when I heard that Columbus would direct the movie -- Home Alone, need I say more? I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a rather dark movie considering that it is a children's film. Luckily, there are some comic scenes as well -- though not nearly as many as in the book.
The acting from the adult actors is brilliant -- as was only expected with such a cast! Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and my personal ""favourite"" Ian Hart (who doesn't have enough screen time, if you ask me) are all great. The child actors is another matter... Daniel Radcliffe has to look surprised, awed and scared all the time. It's kind of boring. I'm sure he will do better in the next movie when -- hopefully -- his eyebrows won't be at the edge of his scalp all the time. The best of the younger actors is without a doubt Rupert Grint who plays Ron. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is also good.
There are certain aspects of the film that are absolutely brilliant. Cinematography, production design, costume design et cetera. Hogwarts, for example, looked almost exactly as I had imagined it.
Harry Potter is a good movie. It's not great, but even if I am somewhat disappointed I still feel that there couldn't have been a better adaptation of the novel (well, perhaps Terry Gilliam could have done something brilliant with the source material). However, images can never replace Rowling's language and style. Believe me, the best H.P.-movie you will ever see is the one you see in your mind when you read the novel.
Still, it is a job well done by Columbus and screenwriter Steven Kloves and everyone else who worked on the film. (6/10)",24 November 2001,6,,
"One of the most hyped films of the year, Rowlings creation has found fans of all ages, though I must say Im not a diehard fan. And while I have to say I mildly enjoyed it, the film has done nothi",chrisbrown6453,"So far, the film has been well received by its young fans and most critics. Some critics and myself are less enthusiastic. Indeed, a friend of mine who has read the book was quick to point out that it was made simpler and more childish. If only director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves had done their jobs as well as the set designers, cast and visual effects people, this would have been the film of the year. As it stands, it is reduced to a moderately entertaining diversion which probably doesnt even warrant cinematic viewing. And to think it began so well, showing strong signs of plot development. Sadly, it starts to go downhill not long after Harry arrives at Hogwarts.
I do not blame the actors. To be honest, they cant really do too much with their characters, for the screenplay never allows us to feel enough sympathy for them. Daniel Radcliffe is a credible Harry, while Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) show plenty of promise. However, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) is the best performer in the film. John Cleese has a (very funny) small supporting part. Alan Rickman is also pretty convincing, though Ive seen better from him. Richard Harris is fine, and there are also appearances from more famous supporting players such as Maggie Smith and Julie Walters.
The film is not without its great moments. The Quidditch game is NOT one of them though. The scene with the magic mirror, however, does standout. But the moment the story surrounding the stone begins, things begin to slide. Its not that the storyline isnt detailed, its just not exciting enough. There are surprises, but there seem to be less of those than predictable resolutions. To add insult to injury, the musical score is just as bland as some of the films characters.
Visually, the film succeeds. Columbus has recreated Harry Potters world in a very appealing way, and many of the best scenes feature the use of visual effects. When the plot doesnt hold your interest, the effects and scenery do.
For all this films flaws, it still has the capacity to entertain many, notably its child fans. Despite that, I still hope the probable sequel is much better.",12 June 2002,7,,

Welcome to the world of Harry Potter,willcundallreview,"Rating-7/10
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is the starting movie in one huge and magical film franchise based on the books of the same name. This film for me was good, not great I must add but one movie that truly shows us something new and makes people just generally happy afterwards. It isn't awesome by any stretch of the imagination and I'll go into that later on but this does at least set a bench mark in film, one that started one of the biggest film franchises of all time.
The movie is a nice mix between a kind of light and lovely kind of thing, but then dark and oddly scary in certain ways. The movie is for the most part heart-warming and gives you a beautiful sense of ""I'm there"" kind of feeling and one which instantly connects you with the characters. The plot can have it's more terrifying moments and especially maybe for the young viewers, a certain scene including the Forbidden Forest comes to mind on that one.
Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are not great as our main heroes but they're not bad either actually, they don't really know how to act just yet but they still regain that nice sweet feeling about them which is all that counts here. The whole cast is a plethora of greats, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and many others contribute to the great cast who just make this film really what it is and make it all importantly, fun.
It's possible as they say, that Christopher Columbus the director stuck too close to the books here and really should have deviated from the scenes which well, only work in the book. I applaud him for staying true but I have to say the film is over long and stuffed full of long periods where very little happens and that can at times make this seem slightly dull. I do like Columbus here though, I think he directs well and Steve Kloves adapts the screenplay pretty well too, yet again good all round.
Now one thing that may not be most remembered but for me should are the special effects which for the day are really great and make this so much more exciting at times. Certain scenes just wouldn't work without them being good and the team behind it seem to create a visually good looking film too. Staying on the way this looks the sets are magnificent and truly incredibly done, on such a large scale it is difficult but they pull it off and first time as well.
I felt this film is like an epic that is both for adults and kids and that is for me what sets this apart from other such movies in the fantasy genre. It shouldn't leave anyone feeling negative afterwards and really makes you kind happy in a way that leaves you positive about the whole movie and is another reason this is so memorable. It's hard to not fall in love with the Harry Potter world, the film not so much but the thing it is set in, very much so.
Overall a good movie and also one that kick-starts a huge franchise of films that are so remembered and will be for me, in years to come. It's the kind of movie that isn't great but is still a classic in senses, so many people around the world can quote it and words and phrases from this movie continue to be used in everyday speech, just magically wonderful.",10 July 2015,7,,
A poorly constructed film with much storyline confusion,PyrolyticCarbon,"I had a dim view of the Potter series of books for sometime now, with a mixture of reading reviews and total rebellion at the complete overhype of them. However I'd recently sat down and started thinking about how biased and closed those ideas were and thought that I should at least give them a go. Never happened though, and I committed myself to watching the first movie in the DVD Boxset which I gave my girlfriend for her Christmas.
Well, it does have a lot of the traditional elements of a kids adventure yarn, and there are some exciting moments, but for me the story was far too packed with ideas and unexplored side stories. There were flat, pantomime characters, and quite a few unexplained events and character choices, things just seemed to happen without any prior warning with the explanation being left to the very end. A very sloppy story telling device when the writer has backed the characters into a corner or has run out of time.
Some of the animation work was excellent, and yet the main scene of Quidditch was quite poor with all the animation being shown from a distance and at high speed. It really did look like the video game version, and there is perhaps all the answer we need.
Still, there was some adventure to be had, and some of the action was good, however equally editing on some of the action left a lot to be desired and simply confused events or served to pad them out without interest. A lot of these moments there was a feeling of cost or effects budget strain.",26 December 2004,4,,

A masterpiece brought to life,goshamorrell,"''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J. K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an ""Indiana Jones"" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough. Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning. During ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was pretty sure I was watching a classic, one that will be around for a long time, and make many generations of fans. It takes the time to be good. It doesn't hammer the audience with easy thrills, but cares to tell a story, and to create its characters carefully. Like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Star Wars"" and ""E. T.,"" it isn't just a movie but a world with its own magical rules. And some excellent Quidditch players. Watch Alan Rickman drawing out his words until they seem ready to snap, yet somehow staying in character. Maggie Smith, still in the prime of Miss Jean Brodie, is Prof. Minerva McGonagall, who assigns newcomers like Harry to one of the school's four houses. Richard Harris is headmaster Dumbledore, his beard so long that in an Edward Lear poem, birds would nest in it.",28 January 2022,10,,
The boy who lived,Darkjak007,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or if your from Europe the philosopher's stone. The story that started it all today marks the the films 20th anniversary. Harry Potter life changes forever when all of sudden he finds out that he's a famous wizard. So here we are at hogwarts school of witch craft and wizardry Where kids learn the fundamentals of the magic world. Here harry meets his bestest friends and from there on his life changes forever. While so much has happens in this franchise, the sorcerer's stone has alway held a top spot for me primary because of it's tone. As the the series went on each installment became more and more epic and serious. Though along with the chamber of secrets this helped build the world of Harry Potter as we know it now. This world magical and whimsical from the very first shot of hogwarts to the the great hall. Accommodate by John Williams soundtrack draw you into this setting, and looking back I can't but, love falling in love with this Cast. Not just for nostalgic feel but everybody gives a damn great performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint as Ron Harry and Hermione. These kid's sell the whole film from the way they play off each other to their three personalities. That moment they meet on the train you know right at that moment these three are going to be inseparable. Malfoy is such a conniving pompous little ass, you just really want to smack this boy. He's literally everything resent about his child with Dursleys cruel and Selfish. Every kid does a great job it's some of the best child acting ever. The hogwart staff are also great Maggie smith as professor Mcgonagall gives such this loving bearing grandma personality clearly someone who love her students and her job. Very strict,but is open to having fun. The late Richard Harris as Dumbledore who even though he was only in two film, I still remember his portrayal from the early content. He had this very traditional Merlin style and spoke with such a soft yet wise speaking voice. It has always made me wonder want Dumbledore would have been like if he was still around for the others films. Of course arguably everybody's favorite character in the whole series Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Rickman clearly put his all into this character without a doubt his most famous role. He adds such this slimy malevolent charm to this character to the way he speak to the way he stares, before you even know his name you know this guy just gonna make everybody life hell. Also Hagrid I love Hagrid he such a big lovable oaf it can't be helped. While there's so much that this film has succeeded in making, it does have some gripes and minor issues. Firstly is the the pacing it does feel that in the middle of the film it can feel rather padded in a way and that primary because there's some much show and telling in the this film. It has to set up some much on how this school and this world works that it tend to seem a bit much in some parts. The Sorcerer's stone isn't mentioned until around an hour and a half in. The visuals as stated already are great from practical make and sets like the goblins and the chessboard are dedication to the craft. Though some of the cg while getting the job done for the time some does look rather off. The quidditch game make uses of it well with the field, in the game itself is epic and exciting, but when you have these fully computer generated bodies you can't help but notice them. CG is always been used for the Quidditch in these films, but here it doesn't hold up a bit as well now you can't help but just look at it.",16 November 2021,7,,
Very entertaining!,supertom-3,"I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***",6 December 2001,6,,
Awesome Introduction to a great franchise,EthanBJones_03,,28 January 2017,8,,
"""Harry Potter"" has a magical direction.",eagandersongil,"""Hary Potter"" is the beginning of everything, the beginning of a saga that would become one of the greatest anthologies of cinema that garners many merits, being a good adaptation of the book, a remarkable creation of characters, costumes and aesthetics, the last being its greatest merit.
The script adapted by Steve Kloves manages to synthesize the most important elements of the book, of course, the book is more tense and complete, but steve manages to bring the spirit to the screen just like its director, Chris Columbus, who gives a really magical touch to the film, whether in its details, in its dark photography, the magical elements in the compositions of gothic and bizarre backdrops to even its perfect soundtrack, adding that to a great cast that perfectly matches its characters, the biggest merit here is the feeling that we are watching something really wizard, the displacement with reality is very well constructed.
Far from being perfect but extremely competent, ""Hary Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" sums up the books well, has great characters, although not yet performative, has a beautiful direction, good effects for the time and a timeless art direction. Grade 8/10.",17 August 2021,8,,

Because of they are all the same.I have read four Potter books and I liked the first one but the rest are just almost exactly as the first one.Another thing is that the kids in the books are stereotypes.I mean when I was a kid I was WILD but in Harry Potter all of the kids are little angels(but of course not the ones that are evil,and I do mean evil).
THE FILM: It´s a good adaption from the film even if it is a bit to long(But I don´t think that it could have been shorter).It has magnificent special effects and the acting is also good.John Cleese is in the film for about 10 seconds and says two lines.WHY???????

Destined to become a children's classic the likes of Wizard of Oz.,theshadow908,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is based off the immensely popular book of the same name, about an 11 year old boy who finds out he's actually a wizard, and is sent to a wizard school where evil waits for him at every turn.
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is extremely enjoyable to watch. Just to see all the special effects put to use with the magic sequences is amazing. This is one of those movies that I'll still be watching and enjoying as an adult, like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, or The Wizard of Oz.
The performances in the movie are really good. The director picked all the right people for the roles. Even the three main kids were really good in their parts.

"A great start, to a great franchise",kdnor2011,"To put it simply, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great way to start a francise, a way to find out what works and what doesn't. It's very similar to what Confused Matthew said about the first Spider Man and the Star Trek Reboot, a film to find out how to make the rest of the series will work. The film overrall is great, but since it's the first film, there are a few problems, like the child actors. I mean, compared to most child actors, their frekin amazing, but let's be happy that they got better as the series went on. Plus some of the special effects didn't age well, such as the troll scene. The troll itself still looks pretty cool, but sometimes it so obviously a CGI Harry.
However, as an adabtation, it's one of the best I've ever seen, although I have always wanted to see Peeves in live action. And overall, the production design is absolutely amazing, Warner Brothers were obviously confident that this film would be successful and lead to a franchise to put so much money into it.

Nobody's idea of a visionary director, Chris Columbus landed the delicate task of setting the foundations for what Harry Potter and his world would look like on the screen. As such, the first Potter film is all bright colors and an earnest desire to be faithful to Rowling's written words. Despite Columbus's unimaginative translation, it is amazing how well Rowling's universe suits the screen, with dazzlingly visual inventions like the great hall, pivoting stair-cases and the quidditch match.

The major start of all the magic!,Trevor-Kerensky,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",23 March 2018,8,53,
"Well, gee. Now I know what everything in the book looks like without having to use my imagination.",La Gremlin,"Nearly every single scene from _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone_ is in the movie, but there's still something missing. Something big and very important, and it isn't Peeves.
It's the heart.
I saw this train wreck in a dollar theater and felt like I was having the book read to me flatly. All it does is show you what the producers think everything in the story looked like without ever bothering with what the story was ABOUT. I know a movie's in deep, deep trouble when I really couldn't give a pair of fetid dingo kidneys about the title character or his friends.
Do the little ones a big, big favor and sit them in front of ""the Neverending Story"", which has got more imagination in any given frame of film than ""Harry"" has in its entire running length. And it does so while (gasp!) NOT sticking slavishly to the book!",26 March 2002,2,,
Where it All Began!,XxEthanHuntxX,"Had the pleasure of revisiting the Harry Potter serie to rate and review them after many years, and thus a trip down memory lane. My journey, of course, begins with the magical introduction - ""The Philosopher's Stone"".
The first ""Harry Potter"" movie sets the mood directly with John Williams' magnificent music and an owl flying into a dark, misty forest. Soon Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith will make their entrance - three of several veterans in the series, something that has become the films' specialty when it comes to casting
If you compare with the later films, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is clearly more child-friendly and innocent than the rest. Here the characters are presented with warm, loving gestures and the special effects are perhaps inventive but subtle special effects
J.K. Rowling's story is made to be filmed. Distinct characters, ingenious background story, mysterious intrigue, exciting situations and a fantastic environments. Just like Harry and his friends, you get wide-eyed and impressed by the festivities - stairs that move themselves, paintings with living people in them, etc.
It can feel silly and quite ridiculous sometimes and purely developmentally like a plagiarism of other children youth films, but that fact can be overlooked by all the charm and joy it brings. The trio Harry, Ron and Hermione are classic but well-functioning and absolutely sympathetic heroes, with familiar but possibly a bit one-dimensional: personality traits.
The child actors are sweet and have charisma but are hardly chosen for their talents - it took a few years and films before they became professional in conveying the right feelings. The special effects is also very much off easy to see is by no mean subtle. Its disgracefully clear and clearly visible at some points, and I'm pretty surprised of it since my last viewing.
The film may not be groundbreaking in filmmaking but a wonderful and entertaining adventure with the perfect dose of suspense, humour, charm and a satisfying nostalgia trip. We are introduced for the first time to Quidditch, the mantle of invisibility, the flirtatious relationships between the characters and other familiar features.",20 August 2020,6,,
Why hadn't I seen this already?,Puroo,"I think I may sound like a stooge if I say this, but it is now that I have finally watched this movie. Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. So finally yesterday I decided to give it a try and oh my god, it's amazing! Why didn't I see it back when I had the chance to?
It is kinda unbelieveable that such a nicely detailed CGI movie was released in 2001. I know the VFX had grown a lot better since Lord of the Rings trilogy was also made at the same time, but still I was not prepared for it. I was expecting it to be just some regular CGI that didn't age too well. Trust me, if you haven't watched the movie till now, it hasn't aged at all. It can very much still be the selling point of the movie.
I had watched some parts of the movie, like the beginning where Harry's cousin was brought back home after he fell in the snake's cage and the Quidditch scene, but I didn't have any powerful memory of any other scene from the movie. In the scene where Voldemort says to the professor, ""Kill him!"" somehow I used to remember that scene to be the teacher first saying ""What should I do?"" to which Voldemort replies that. And I'm glad I didn't have any previous memory of this movie, because that way I was able to experience everything for the first time.
This movie has the 2001 movie's vibe to it, where the story is very straightforward and the childish background music makes it seem very easy to understand. I haven't seen any other movie of the franchise, as I'm going to watch the next part after writing this review. But I hope it stays that way, since it's very easy to understand and thus I can watch the movie on my phone while doing my work on my laptop.",08-May-21,10,,
Not the strongest of movies but still a huge fan,Mcduff3601,"I first watched this on VHS way back in the day, I remember thinking eh... it was ok, then a few years later got into the books and came back to watch the movies and BAM that was it.
The only thing I will say about this one is it is a little rough for some of the more sensitive kids out there. There is some pretty scary scenes including the death of a unicorn as well as a pretty graphic death scene of one of the characters.
I can re-watch all of the Harry Potter films over and over again from 1 to 8 any time. They are consistently well done and for what the earlier movies 1 to 3 are they are endearing magical stories that have a high entertainment value.",19 November 2018,10,1,
It's harry potter,TheHoodOfSwords,"I mean like it's literally Harry Potter.
This is the movie I've seen the most and because of that I don't like it quite as much as when I was a kid, this one feels the most exposition and plot hole heavy but it's not bad either. It just doesn't appeal to me as much as the others. This is just one of them where I usually skip it over when I want to watch a Harry Potter movie. It's a fun kids movie, but the later ones are more fun as you get older. 5 in particular with the villain.
Some of the CGI looks janky as hell, but some of it still looks good. seeing it around as someone older I don't know how I didn't see the painfully obviously villain twist as a kid.
Looking forward to 3, 4 and 5 since those are my favourites apart from the finale.
It's aight, sets up the series well but it does feel a bit bogged down to me. Still fun though!",18 September 2020,7,,
"Great ambience, but not a perfect film",SMK-4,"The film captures very well the required ambience, it does not appear phony as so many genre rivals do. The set pieces are marvellous. Robbie Coltrane makes a perfect Haggrit and generally the casting is fine, except perhaps Ian Hart as Quirrel; I also would have chosen someone younger than Maggie Smith for the McGonagall part, say Haydn Gwynne.
However, the film is too long. It tries to juggle too many balls, keep too many plot elements and characters from the book [which I read _after_ seeing the film] - and there just is not enough room for it, not even in a two-and-a-half hour long movie. As a result, some characters (notably Draco Malfoy) remain underdeveloped and some elements (e.g. Quidditch) which add weight to the whole school experience as the book brings it across are reduced to the bare minimum for the purposes of the story and consequently increase the predictability of the plot.
Bigger sacrifices should have been made to focus on depth rather than breadth. For example, one might have scrapped the school cup altogether.",30 December 2001,8,,
One word: Awesome!,Adriane,,22 November 2001,0,0,
Potter ROCKS!!,smakawhat,"I am a movie nut. I see a lot of stuff. One thing I don't do though is read often. I use to when I was younger, but I find that at my age works of the printed word rarely raise my interest. Then one day, someone gave me a Potter book, and I was hooked instantly on the characters and the imagination of JK Rowling's world. I have read all 4.
With that being said I was very anxious, and VERY concerned to see the first adaptation of Rowling's first novel. I wondered if they would trash it's world, commercialise it, trivialise it, or worse somehow Americanize it in an attempt to appeal to US audiences. Luckily none of these things have happened there is no sacharine just pure sweet joy.
Chris Columbus has done a marvelous job in directing this film. First off, the movie just looks amazing. The 'other world' beyond the muggles is so richly detailed, every corner alley, every costumed character, every piece of wooden furniture, the shining red train of platform 9 and 3/4's, even the etching of chiseled emblems, team scarves its all there in abundance.
Then you have the young actors. Radcliffe as the perfect Potter, Emma Watson in her bookish teacher pet charm as Hermione, Tom Felton as the slick haired Draco Malfoy Potter's nemesis, and the best Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly Potter's sidekick and best chum who gets all the best lines and steals the show with his facial expressions alone.
Even at 2 1/2 hours long I didn't want this film to end. Sure things have been kept out from the book which is far richer, but if they included everything I am sure the film would have went on for 4 hours straight. What is important is that key scenes were kept that added to the plot of future films for those uninitiated with the story. Also those scenes that are included are just enjoyable, the Quidditch MATCH!!!, Potter in the wand shop, the escaping snake, Fluffy the dog, the flying keys... its all as I had imagined it.
Then you have a cast of minor players which I wish could have more screen time, Father Dursley's bumbling, Hagrid's stern but dumbness persona, and then the best Alan Rickman as the devious professor Snape, who draws out his lines with such skill it makes your skin crawl.
No the movie is not perfect it couldn't have everything, and I do think that those who have not read the book would be somewhat confused by its story as well. But all in all this movie is perfect for fans, adults, kids, and that small 1% of people who have yet to be initiated in the world of Hogwarts.
Bring on book 5 and Chamber of Secrets to film I can't wait.

Harry Potter,freakfire-1,"It did not take long for a book about a young wizard to turn into 7 books at 5 movies so far. And while I am not a fan of this by far, its an OK film to watch.
This movie introduces the world to Daniel Radcliffe and J.K. Rowling. Radcliffe, the protagonist of this film, is a young boy who is invited to join the wizard school Hogwarts. Though he never heard about it before, he eventually gets to join despite his family not wanting him to know about it.
It seems to be an adventure about finding out who his dead parents are and why they are dead. To a lesser extent, its about the stone hidden at the school. But that seems to be only a side adventure.
The movie moves kind of slow at several times, but the acting isn't bad. But bearing in mind the set and the limitations of the book, it did a good enough job. Though it seems that Harry always had an exception made for him.
Overall, its OK. Not great. ""C+""",3 October 2008,6,,
Does The Magic Really Begin Here?,GeorgeRoots,,29 August 2014,6,,

It's all about the magic!,dy158,"I will never, ever forgive myself (just kidding) if I never gave a review to this. Given though I only became a Potter fan after I watched this on DVD, I so know I have to do it.
There must be something about this first instalment that it was actually being aired twice here on the television, with the latest like early last month. I watched it the first time when it was on the television. It really brought back the memories for me.
Based on the best-selling debut novel from JK Rowling, it's about the adventures of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who realises that on his 11th birthday that he is actually a wizard from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who came to receive him. And a famous one, even when Harry was a year old. Thus, it became the beginning of his school life and various adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some of those people he met were like, the son of an old wizarding family- Ronald 'Ron' Weasley (Rupert Grint), the very smart witch who is actually of Muggle (non-magical people, in Potter-speak) parentage- Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the one whom Harry soon knew will become one of those he will never always like- Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and so on. It was because of a troll incident in the girls' toilet (yes, Harry and Ron went there to save Hermione) that Harry, Ron and Hermione became the best of friends since.
Harry was also being discovered as being the youngest Seeker since a century ago as well. His 'popularity' grew. But, someone in the school does not seemed to like him at all like Malfoy. It's his Potions professor- Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Harry, Ron and Hermione thought it was Snape who was being the bad guy in wanting to steal the sorcerer's stone.
But it's someone else. Their Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). They only found out very much later after Harry confronted Quirrell.
Now, with me only being hooked on the Potter series after watching it like four years ago on the DVD, it was start of the endless magic in the series to come. Any Potter fans will surely love this!",18 June 2006,8,,
The boy who lived. a tale of Harry Potter,bluesman-20,I saw this movie first before reading the books and walked away very impressed. The sheer imagination that came with this movie amazed me the story is wonderfully written a kids movie that does not dumb itself down to it's audience. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is a little stiff a little wooden but not overly all considering the fact that he was not a acting expert when he started he manages to do very well. Richard Harris THE man who was born to be Dumbledore I can't imagine anyone else in this role even his eventual replacement in the prisoner of azkaban does not measure up to him. And Robbie Coltrane the heart of the series his Hagrid is a joy to watch as is Emma Watson who is outstanding as Herimone Granger. This movie is a treat and deserves to be watched again and again and in years to come I'm sure it'll be labeled a Classic.,16 February 2008,10,0,
"Philosopher's flick is a respectable start, but feels half baked compared with the rest of the lot (blu-ray review)",Meven_Stoffat,,21 August 2011,7,,
Surprise surprise,Dockelektro,"By the 2000 Sidney Olympics, my country of Portugal had a contestant in the shooting class. It is a sport that requires a lot of concentration and clod blood. So, the athlete has to keep calm. In the TV I saw him shooting and looking down between shots. But he wasn't just looking down. He was reading ""Harry Potter"". When I was confronted with the opening of this movie, I wasn't really interested, thought it was too childish. But thenm there had to be a reason why the books appealed to children, adults, everyone. So when inevitably I saw this one, the result was an instant feeling of empathy towards it. I can only say that if they are trying to charm the viewer, if they are trying to involve him in the movie's sheer magic, they succeeded all the way. Now I understand why this one has so many fans. It is simply irresistible. It gives you something that you always search for when you go watch a movie - the power to be in another place for a few hours. And the movie delivers this and many more: all the production values are epic and magnificent, the John Williams score being a sort of conductor of all the emotions you experience when seeing this. The definition of movie magic doesn't come any closer than this! This movie makes you a child again, and thus it is unmissable.",9 September 2002,8,,
The Sorcerer's Stone is a highly imaginative film narrative that is compelling and a pleasure to watch.,Eternality,"This is still my personal Potter favorite. The Sorcerer's Stone is still the film that opened my eyes to the world of young wizards and witchcraft. Its sequels are worth recommending, but it becomes increasingly less magical and wondrous. No matter how great a film is, it's rare for the film to capture fully the essence of the book. Harry Potter is no exception. This is the work and imagination of the filmmakers themselves, not necessarily what we believe it should be. Another director could have seen the world of Harry Potter in a different light.
Chris Columbus (Home Alone) fortunately sees Harry Potter's world in a way that satisfies the majority of die-hard Potter fans. There's enough movie magic to enthrall and engage even non-Potter fans (which includes me). The Sorcerer's Stone delivers in most areas, giving us a detailed glimpse of the fantasy world unlike any other fantasy movies. The action sequences are exciting but not a standout on its own. The young leading cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson give exceptional performances that pull the strings of the film together, without being too brash or childish.
The Oscar nominated score by John Williams highlights his amazing musical ability time and time again, giving a grandeur, mystifying sound to the production. The only major problem the Harry Potter movie series faced was the competition and the higher standards set by the Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) screen trilogy which was launched at nearly the same time. Somehow, The Sorcerer's Stone feels amateurish compared to the Fellowship of The Ring. It's also probably the reason Harry Potter will always play second fiddle to LOTR. But on its own, The Sorcerer's Stone is a highly imaginative film narrative that is compelling and a pleasure to watch. Wingardium leviosa! Petrificus Totalus!

The Beginning of the Epic Saga,ajkbiotech,"The Harry Potter Novels were a cultural & literary phenomenon.
Our daughter, born in 1994, was squarely in the generation that most fully read & absorbed the JK Rowling books as they arrived and were read.
As parents, we were along for the ride, reading the books and watching all the films as they arrived.
The films, delightfully, were incredibly fine adaptations of the books.
Starting with this first film, the saga begins.

A fair first outing for the famous Boy Wizard,cosmic_quest,"'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' no doubt divided many fans of the 'Harry Potter' novels, of whom I am one. The film adaptation of a much loved book was never going to please everyone and, while it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, there is no denying that it has both good and bad points.
For those who have just flown in from Pluto, the hero of PS is young Harry Potter, a bi-spectacled British boy who has lived with his brutish relatives since he was orphaned at the age of fifteen months. However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry's life changes forever when he discovers his secret legacy...that he is a wizard. He sets off eager to start his First Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, making friends with fellow First Years, know-all Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, the sixth son of an impoverished but kindly Pureblooded wizarding family. Yet life is not destined to be all fun and games for as our young hero quickly adapts to this wonderful new world, he learns the disturbing truth behind his parents' deaths and that sometimes evil doesn't die easily.
The quality of the adult actors was just superb. Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Molly and Arthur Weasley were all destined to play these roles, truly bringing the characters to life in a way I didn't think would be possible. I was less keen on Richard Harris' Dumbledore, feeling he was just a shade too cold and stand-offish to play an paternal man who the neglected Harry came to trust with ease. That said, the adult cast were definitely the backbone of the film, especially in light of the rather mediocre child cast.
While Daniel Radcliffe may resemble the living embodiment of Harry Potter, it was evident from his lacklustre performance in PS that he was chosen purely on looks rather than talent. At the best of times, he portrayed Harry as a rather bland and uninspiring hero and, at his lower moments, he was just cringe-worthy (the scene where he discovers he is a wizard is particularly clunky). Devon Murray, who played Seamus, and James and Oliver Phelps, cast as the Weasley twins, were equally as wooden. However, there are a few gems in the group. Tom Felton was excellent in bringing the maliciously mischievousness of Draco Malfoy to life and he is, undoubtedly, the best of the bunch. Emma Watson's Hermione was suitably condescending and obnoxious as the character was aged eleven (sadly, come GoF, Emma didn't comprehend that Hermione had largely out-grown the conceitedness was an integral part of her character in PS). While Tom Felton was the best of the child cast overall, Rupert Grint, who played Ron, was the best of the trio, bringing to the character a quiet loyalty to his friend balanced with the boyish exuberance that was very much apparent to eleven-year-old Ron.
The script might be a tad too childish for those over twelve, with not enough focus on the more interesting adult characters, but I believe it suited the mood of the novel given Harry was eleven in PS so viewed the wizarding world in the very innocent, awestruck manner of a child. Director Chris Columbus nicely compliments this by capturing a wondrous, Disney-like feel to Hogwarts in a way that leaves the audience joining Harry in his delight at exploring the magic of the wizarding world. The special effects are acceptable with the exception of the cartoony Quidditch match, which seems to have been lifted straight from the Nintendo video game and awkwardly pasted to the film, and the hideously computerised centaur.
PS was a fair adaptation, enjoyable in itself although no-where near the epic of LotR. It does capture the innocence of the characters at a time when they believed the world was neatly divided into good and evil and magic could sort any problem, however, older fans will most likely find the faster, mature pace of the adaptations of the latter novels more suited to their tastes as, in comparison, PS seems to be directed mainly at little fans under twelve.",20-May-06,6,,
Fantastic Start To The Harry Potter Story,dommercaldi,"Pros: 1. The sound design is incredible, especially in regards to the spell-casting. It really makes the magic come alive. 2. The score is great and created one of the most iconic scores of all time. It still gives me chills when it plays. 3. The practical and special effects are done well, and still hold up nearly 20 years later for the most part. 4. The costume and set design are immense and they do an amazing job at helping to build the wizarding world. 5. There is fantastic chemistry between all of the actors onscreen and it's beautiful to watch, especially between Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger),and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). 6. The likes of Emma Watson, Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Ian Hart (Professor Quirrell), and Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) give really good performances. 7. There is some really exquisite and innovative camera-work. One brilliant example of this would be the shot of the owls entering the great hall to deliver the mail. 8. The action scenes are enthralling and well-choreographed, particularly in regards to the quidditch and the chess game sequences.
Cons: 1. There is some strange directing choices involving framing and zoom-ins. 2. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe is a little patchy at times. 3. Admittedly, some of the special effects haven't aged well at all.",9 April 2020,8,,
Quite Funny,Emerenciano,"For the ones who have read the book in which this film is based this is a funny, enchanting and good movie. For the people who haven't read the novel by J.K. Rowling it may be fool and empty.

Everything changes and he is told he is a famous wizard in another world to which he must go to start his studies on Witchcraft and then face the dangerous Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents and wants to control Hogwarts School.
Chris Columbus, who have directed quite a few movies for the whole family, did a great work when adapting the story for the cinema. It's obvious that some details brought on the novel are not included on the film, but the cinema version of Harry Potter's saga pleasing and full of magic anyway.

"A little rough around the edges, but in the long run you won't mind",squirrel_burst,"""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (Or Sorcerer's stone depending on your region) introduces a complicated world filled with a lot of ideas and characters. It isn't perfect and it's obvious that as the first instalment, it was unclear to the director and screenwriter as to what would work and what wouldn't. Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book). I wouldn't say that my love for the Harry Potter series, both the films and the books influence me when I say that this is a good movie.

Epic film,stormhawk2021,"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here.

"Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing",bababear,"Cut about an hour out of the middle of HARRY POTTER and you'll have a pretty decent little movie. As is, it's a bloated mess. There's no heart to this, no characterizations. It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it.
Seeing actors of the caliber of Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith wading through this, I wondered what went through their minds while they were performing. They have to eat and pay bills like the rest of us, but the last time I felt so sorry for actors was watching Dudley Moore in SANTA CLAUS.
There's no need for viewers to feel any emotional reaction. The goshawful musical score by John Williams telegraphs everything to us and makes sleeping during the dull parts nearly impossible.

Well done... Kudos!,The_Core,"I'm one of the ""holdouts"" who hasn't read the books (I like Ursula K. Leguin's ""Earthsea"" series, so I figure I'd enjoy this story, although it's somewhat derivative of ""A Wizard of Earthsea""). Anyway, I kept wishing I was 10 years old when I saw this, because I would have enjoyed it more. Still, the film was undeniably magical, the CGI/Special effects weren't overdone (or were seamless enough to blend in), and the acting was excellent.
Agreed with other reviewers that the film never ""soars"" and never fully achieves what it could, but attribute this to squeezing so much plot into the film's running time. If this movie is as faithful to the book as I understand, then it's a rarity -- ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" are two others that manage to be faithful to the book, yet in the former case somehow outdoes the book (may be the first and only time).
Anyway, I'm rambling. This film was magical & entertaining, especially for kids. I think it suffers only from the fact that expectations were set too high due to hype, and the unbelievable popularity of the books. You just can't expect a film to live up to the potential of the book, especially if the book is tremendously good -- it's patently unfair to judge a film based on that criteria. 9/10.",1 December 2001,9,,
"A fine, refreshing fantasy tale.",galileo3,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)
7.5/10
JK Rowling, who has amassed a fortune in excess of a billion dollars, begun with an idea that strolled into her head one day as she was travelling on the train.
This film (and the book) displays the unlimited potential of the human mind. Fantasy, Adventure, Magic. All are present in this film that is destined to become a children's classic. And it should.
Harry Potter 1 is a distillation of all the fine elements from the book and brought to the screen in impressive detail. This film is more for children than for adults (this is my opinion for all the series, then again adults probably like it more than children so it doesn't matter.)
This is enjoyable, fun and often comical cinema. As far as it could be from real life.

a great beginning to an epic series,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a film that is not only a great beginning to the HP series, but it stands up well as a family mystery film, with a few light hearted moments here and there. Add in an almost dead on adaptation of the phenomenal novel, 3 nice showings from the young kids, and an excellent supporting cast, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is a winner.
Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has always been shunned aside his whole life. His parents died in a car crash at the tender age of 1, and he's been very reluctantly raised by his aunt and uncle, Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Vernon (Richard Griffiths). Add in their bratty son Dudley (Harry Melling), and you've got one bad childhood for young Harry. Then, one night, after days of mysterious letters from a place called Hogwarts, a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) tells Harry that he's a wizard! However, Harry does learn some disturbing news along with this great news. His parents were not killed in a car crash, but murdered, by the most evil wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, who then failed in his attempt to kill Harry, then fled, his powers mysteriously broken....Harry then comes to Hogwarts, the school for wizards, makes 2 friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and later Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He also makes his fair share of enemies, including Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), while meeting the mysterious staff and leaders of Hogwarts, including the fatherly Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), his housemaster Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), the oft-frightened Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart), and the dark and mysterious Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Welcome to Harry's first year at Hogwarts!
The film gets strong supporting performances from the adults, especially the four I just mentioned. Ian Hart gives a great performance as the always scared, extremely apprehensive Quirrell, while keeping a mysterious aura about him. Rickman is once again excellent as the most mysterious character in the entire series. Harris and Smith add the two parental figures that Harry's lacked his whole life, guiding him and disciplining him together.
As this is a children's film, the fact that it stays entertaining and will keep adults interested makes it even better. It's a great film for the whole family to enjoy, with some funny moments from Rupert Grint and Richard Harris towards the end. The young children give off great performances for 10 and 11 year olds, and it's definitely a good sign for the future of the series. The direction is good from Chris Columbus, keeping it easy to follow for the kids. There are some scary moments, so I'd say kids under 8 years old could be frightened a bit. This is the only one of the Potter's that is well written, so enjoy it now. John Williams also gives a great score and a landmark theme that you'll have stuck in your head for a while. 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a real winner for the whole family. Have fun!! 8/10 --spy",30-May-06,8,,

"Faithful to the book, but missing something",basrutten,"For a book adaptation, ""Harry Potter and the Socerer's/Philosopher's stone"" is a fairly good effort. It remains as faithful to the book as possible, and leaves out very little in term of story. Unfortunately, it DOES leave out most of the humour of the book (which was to be expected, you simply can't put all those funny descriptions in the movie), but it sadly doesn't replace them with much else.
I agree with many people that the main problem with this movie is the direction. We all know and love the story, the acting is generally good, the special effects are adequate (some shots are really fake!) etc , but it all feels so very dry, the director didn't really add his own touch to the movie, like really good directors like Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg would do. Most of the famous actors are severely underused, too.
Most of this of course doesn't really matter as kids will still love this movie, but as it is, ""Harry Potter"" is more like a ""painting by numbers""- exercise, while in the right hands it could have been a Picasso.",30 July 2002,6,,
The first Potter film is a spectacle worth seeing.,MovieGuy109,"I have watched Harry Potter and its stars grow from adolescence to adulthood. This is the beginning of the journey. And I would say that Potter got off to a good start. The Sorcerer's Stone is full of neat visuals and charming characters. Though I have never read the novel, I can tell from this adaptation that it is a pleasant read. The young actors are also excellent here, unlike most child actors who rely solely on their age in order to give them the passing grade. It is a fun, yet flawed adventure bound to please young and old alike with its magical charms and a keen sense of adventure, wonder, mystery, and of course magic.",23 July 2011,8,0,
Great children's fantasy,mistoppi,"Chris Columbus has mostly directed movies for the whole family. His imprint is clear. The first Harry Potter movie is clearly a very childlike fantasy. It's mostly aimed for children, and no one's trying to hide it. Sure, people of all ages can watch it, and the book isn't just meant for kids, but the movie is just so clearly meant for children, which can make it slightly annoying. But it's fascinating to see how that changes when the series goes on. The movies change a lot considering their target audience was growing up the whole time, and they eventually look like a dark young adult fantasy instead of this colourful fantasy for children..
This first movie adaptation annoys me so much. They've followed the book closely, some lines are straight from the book. Yet so much is missing. So many important details are gone. Of course not everything can make it to the film but still it bothers many viewers who have read the books. Also even if the movie is long it seems to happen so fast.
It's an entertaining movie but after so any years they lose some of their magic. It's sad, of course, but it's mostly the fault of the audience (in this case, me) and not the movies.",15 October 2016,6,,

Now, when I saw it, I was more relieved then anything, I went in expecting the worst out of it and it was only really watching it on DVD for the first time that I realized that it really was a great movie and apart from a horrible habit of overacting on Hermoines (Forgive Speeling)part it was held together excellently. Another thing, Daniel Radcliffe did one of the best child actors performances ever as he was Harry Potter, he was not the actor playing Harry Potter but he was actually Harry Potter. I also think the actor playing Ron (Ruprint Grint) is an excellent addition to the class and does well as Harry's sidekick during the film. I think all fans of the Harry Potter books will love this film and the many sequels that followed and even though the acting skills of Hermoine had not yet developed, they got there.

"Enjoyable, but hardly brilliant.",Aidan McGuinness,"I came to the film without having read the books. I had heard the movie followed slavishly to the novel but I reckoned if the movie was good enough, that shouldn't matter. So did the film feel like the adaption of a novel? Yes, very much so. It's obvious director Chris Columbus was scared of doing anything too radical with the material and so the movie tends to get bogged down at times. Certain elements in books do not translate well to movies unless done with a bit of flair - Columbus doesn't do this and so there is a certain weakness to the movie's structure. The acting isn't outstanding either among the kids. Daniel Radcliffe left as much of an impression on me as a battering with a soft feather would. It's not like he's from the dreadful Jake ""Phantom Menace"" Lloyd school of acting but he's entirely unremarkable all the same. Very forgettable performance. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) are similarly perfunctionary and nothing more. The best performance is probably shared by Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who really come across exactly what I would imagine from a kids book. The directing is perfectly competent and some of the action scenes are handled well - the quidditch match stands out most of all. Obviously Columbus was constrained by the material at hand and the target audience - I was hardly expecting to see Darren Aronofsky split-screen images of Hermione and Harry talking... The whole thing ends up like a well-done but by-the-numbers piece. No innovation here, no gambles. It was made to be as inoffensive as possible while trying to please as many. It's too long and could do with some pruning but in the end you're still left with an enjoyable movie. Just not a particularly brilliant one. 6.5/10",17 December 2001,6,,

The book was a great story that has you struggling to put it down. It was suspenseful and nicely paced. A good read. But when it comes to the movie all of that seems to just disappear. It was not suspenseful and way too quick. I saw the movie before i read the book and the book was way better.
The visual effects were very good. It had better effects than some movies today(i am talking to you people behind the visual effects in I am legend).
The acting was terrible. The adult actors were good. Such as Alan Rickman,Robbie Coltrane,Richard Harris and Maggie Smith. But the child actors were terrible. I know your not suppose to expect much from 11 year old kids but when you have to spend two and a half hours with it the viewing of a movie becomes a bit sour.
The things that were intense in the book are weak and uninteresting in the movie. A real treat in this movie is the music. From the great John Williams. My favourite movie music man.
I recommend this if you have read the book but don't expect much. Luckily the sequels offer a lot more.

Wonderful start to an iconic film seires,coasterdude44,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very well done adaptation of the book and is a magical start to the story of Harry and Hogwarts that will span over 10 years and 8 films. The movie introduced a number of new child actors which would go on to become famous and beloved worldwide as they grew into adulthood.
Chris Columbus's style of direction captured the magic and wonder of the wizarding world that J.K. Rowling created and the innocence and likeability of our main characters. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were all perfectly casted for their roles. Their acting was pretty shaky in the first film but all did a great job for their first performances as they would vastly improve and mature as the films went on.
It's a hefty introduction to the world of Harry Potter with also a memorable score that captures the atmosphere of J.K. Rowlings world very well.

"Great in some ways, messy in others",guskeller,"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is great in some ways and messy in others. On the positive, it creates an ambitious, fantastical world. The settings, wardrobes, and props all carry ample weight in producing a magical atmosphere. Meanwhile, the iconic music sets an adventurous and mystical tone. Lastly, the casting is excellent. Most of the adults are extremely talented (namely Alan Rickman) and the children, despite their novice here, all became quite respected in their own rights. Together, this establishes a foundation for the franchise to build on.
On the other hand, The Sorcerer's Stone's most glaring flaw is its inconsistent acting. The children are decent for their age, but that is faint praise. Plus, they are center stage so their shortcomings are more noticeable. Next, the writing is cliché. Because the emotional beats are rushed, the plot corniness stands out and rings slightly hollow. Finally, while the special effects are elaborate and occasionally strong, there is plenty of CGI that aged poorly. Unfortunately, this holds that aspect back from being an outright strength. In the end, The Sorcerer's Stone is a very competent film that falls a bit short of its lofty notoriety.

Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors.

Great Film. Aged Well.,RhapsodyReviews,"Review: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K.

Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (Richard Harris), Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame. I would say that the casting of the film is perfect. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. They steal your heart and every scene they are in. Also, the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane make their characters likable. Sometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. The film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by. Overall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. I go back to this movie all the time, and I highly recommend it. 4.5/5",7 November 2019,9,,

As a disclaimer, I am not a direct fan of the fantasy genre, and have not read J.K Rowling's revered books. However, as a film (and later, film franchise), Harry Potter is brought alive in a wonderful manner.
Daniel Radcliffe is completely wonderful as the introvert hero, and when he smiles, all the cruelty of the universe is dimmed. Rupert Grimp and Emma Watson are equally wonderful portraying their characters to near-perfection as the quirky and over-achiever, respectively. Most importantly, the bond of friendship between them is magical.

His grandparents are reluctant to send him, but luckily, Hagrid comes and takes Harry to his new school. Unfourtunatley, Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) the man who killed Harry's parents is lurking about the school, searching for Harry.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes a solid fantasy movie, but it seems to have a few clichés. And, it seems to be pretty simple and undeserving of a higher, for an odd reason, I cannot think of at the moment. I guess it just seems to un-imaginative. Magic and fantasy creatures don't immediately make a movie look imaginative.
Harry Potter is the start of a fantastic series, but easily the 'lightest.' The other ones are a lot darker, which is why I like them better.

"Mystical, Magical and Magnificent.",TuckMN,"A near perfect film.
With a run-time of 2 hours and 32 minutes this is an incredible piece of filmmaking.
Though it is sometimes slow it is never ponderous but instead glorious. It moves magnificently across the screen like an unstoppable force.
It is never easy to make a film where children act the lead roles but Director Christopher Columbus achieves it with elegance and style.
The characters of Hermione, Ron and, of course, Harry, were all brilliantly cast, as was the entire rest of the film -- especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape. Wonderful faces and true characters just from the look of the actors.
No amount of screen time or set element is too small; the attention to detail is superb and the overall feel' of the film evokes the magic and sense of awe and wonder that it should.
It is magnificently photographed. The scenes at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, in the U.K. could not have been a better location -- it is truly wondrous.
The score by the master of film music, John Williams, is haunting and plaintive when it should be and stirring, robust and inspiring when the scene calls for it.
The special effects are genius: worked into the story and adding to it but never detracting from it. This is after all a story about magic!
The lighting was inspired: the perfect interplay of light and shadow leaving just the right touch to the imagination; and in one scene when a character says It all became blackness' the screen flashes to white.
This is a film as much for adults as it is for children: there are some scary parts and some ironic humour and some clever word play.
All in all Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is going to be one of the classics of filmmaking; I can't wait for the sequel.",28 November 2001,9,,

9 on a scale of 10,len-21,"I went into this movie somewhat concerned about whether the subject matter would be offensive to me or anyone else who took religion seriously. I am quite aware that in western culture we tend to overlook many issues that conflict with historical (and conservative) religious viewpoints. Halloween would be a great example.
However, as I watched this movie I realized that considering the absence of any direct references to God or to the Devil, everything else was pretty much fair game. Furthermore, I had to ask myself why would this movie be offensive and yet evil, non human entities such as the Klingons or the Borg aren't. And, I couldn't come up with an answer. So, I look at it as a modern day fantasy (which it is) set in London that isn't all that much different than a futuristic science fiction movie about the struggle between good and evil.
Once I was over that issue, I could examine the movie on its merits. I had no idea how long it was until someone told me the time after the movie. I thought it was probably 2 hours, but I was surprised to hear it was over 2 1/2 hours. That clearly is a positive because it meant I wasn't bored.
The movie is extremely well crafted and the special effects are first rate. I was reminded of so many other movies as I watched it from Superman to the Wizard of Oz. But, it was about as unique a movie as you could ever hope to see. Having not read the book (a ridiculous waste of time when I can get it all for just a 2 1/2 hour investment), I had no idea how fantastic was/is the imagination of JK Rowling. How anyone could create an entire world such as this is remarkable - to say the least. Really, the Einstein of imagination.
One other thing. I noticed that the best two women groups in IMDB were under 18 years old and over 45 years old. And, the best men group is over 45 years old. That also is remarkable. It says that a story about a young boy in a fantasy world is liked as much or more by geezers such as myself.

Entertaining and a good movie to boot.,ryangilmer007,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone) entertains and remains with the audience after the mere ""pop-corn experience"". Basically the movie is a very pleasing delight and it is magnified more so by the lack of quality movies in the summer (and early fall) of 2001. This (perhaps), along with the huge following of the books, led to its huge opening and then rather precipitous collapse at the box office.
Coming into the movie with no pretenses (i.e. 1:Not comparing it to The Phantom Menace (with is a good movie, but has flaws) or any other movie. 2: Not expecting Titanic-like box office numbers (Titanic was based off of a true event that entrals us, Potter is just great fantasy) 3:Not expecting anything specific out-of-it as I did not read the book beforehand and did not research into the characters before viewing)
I was very pleased. The casting is very good, with Hagrid and some of the older/wiser wizards topping the charts. I was a tad surprised that some name actors (or at least known actors had very small roles: Warwick Davis and Cleese to name a couple), and I for the most part like the use of special effects to enhance the story rather than override it (like most of the 2001 summer movies did).
The movie though is not perfect.
1-Some special effects shots are mind blowing (i.e. the candles at the dinner hall), but others are rediculously fake looking (mainly when kids are swinging wildly from trolls or brooms).
2-Some of the cuts just dont make sense. (i.e. when some of the kids get in trouble for having tea with Hagrid, Why do they get in trouble for being with Hagrid, his property is not off of school grounds? There is no basis for it).
Afterwards, I read the book and for the most part the movie is very faithful, yet-->
The movie also looses some of its magic in the last half, when it cuts out parts to quicken the story. More on the dragon would have been great, the other 2 challenges would have been good, and even only a few more minutes to clarify the current challenges would be better. Also, some of the differences seem to be made just for the sake of change, (i.e the movie and the book have some of the same punishments and rewards, but the points are changed).
However, the movie still entertains. The qualms are really just minor issues, but they do keep the first of 7 Harry Potter movies from being truely great. Instead its just really good and that ""ain't"" half bad.",28 December 2001,8,,

Happy Potter and the Sorcerers stone- no magic for me,Ibuk,"I am probably one in a minority when I say that I do not like Harry Potter. I thought it was overlong and a tad bit boring, it was however funny in places. I also liked the quote at the end where Harry says ""I am not going home not really"". Harry Potter was released alongside Lord of the Ring, I saw both I preferred LOTR. I don't however hate all of the Harry Potter films, I thought the Prisoner of Azkaban was good and so was the Goblet of fire.
This is a movie aimed at kids. They will be blown away by the magic and the action. I think I would have had a different view if I saw it when I was a child. Like for instance Star Wars is heavily criticized these days but I saw it as a child and I was blown away, for me it is a bit of nostalgia.

Special effects take over and it has a very small plot!Wait for it on DVD/Videotape!,Doc_Who,"Well today, I finally caved in and saw this movie. For starters I'm sick and tired about ""Harry Potter"". What I saw was just as I was expecting for a very big hyped movie. The movie itself had a very small plot(mainly Harry's first year at special school for wizards) and a small subplot about a special stone. This acting at times seems very wooden from both the actors, the extras etc. There is special effects overkill in this movie.
The running time is a little over 2 1/2 hours. This movies moves very slowly a lot of the time. Even when they have special effects it seems like it's a too long of a movie. I liked the adult actors, but I hope the child actors playing Harry Potter etc do not get typecast as they could if they play their roles until they are grown up. I also wondered if parts of this movie were left out on the cutting room floor.
I say if you are die hard fan of the series, see this movie, But if you are causal fan or just sick and tired of the whole ""Harry Potter"" thing wait for it on DVD/videotape.",8 December 2001,5,0,
Unimaginative and Boring,atzimo,"Literally anyone could write this story. Nothing is original, the effects are mostly bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the music score was written by John Williams 25 years ago (if you get my meaning).
This movie isn't funny enough, dark enough or smart enough to be considered interesting. It's very simple and too boring.
The studio executives have gone really stupid nowadays; the original and interesting ideas are never promoted, they always seem to go for the safe (meaning stupid) bet.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Review,AnishMisra,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.
Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.
Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.
Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.
Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.
Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.
I am going with an 8/10.",4 July 2018,8,,
A Magical Experience,schroeder-gustavo,"The first Harry Potter film does a great job in introducing us to all the main characters that are important throughout the franchise. It is a wonderful movie that has great cinematography, surprisingly great acting coming from really young kids and just a sense of wonder, adventure and imagination throughout.
I believe the movie truly is a treat especially for fans of the book, since the film is extremely faithful to it. The only real flaw I think this movie has is the fact that it was filmed during a very experimental time in the CGI-ERA and most of the CGI looks pretty bad and dated. I am not kidding there are many scenes in the movie, that looking closely, it looks just like a cartoon.
However, this rather small flaw does not affect the movie's plot, nor its magic and it certainly cannot hide the fact that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing movie that introduces us to a beautiful and magical world.",29 July 2015,10,0,
Wonderful entrance into the wizarding world of Harry Potter!,pritol,"This is a wonderful and very enjoyable introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter, and the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I've never read the books, but the world presented to us is rich in detail, and just sucks you in, in a very comfortable and inviting way.
The cast is absolutely tremendous, huge number of very accomplished actors and actresses, who seem to revel in such a fun environment. The music is perfect, and has a childlike but heart warming quality, similar in many ways to a lot of Christmas films.
As fun and as child friendly as the film is, the story doesn't lack depth and has some brilliant moments of intrigue, teeing up all the following sequels to come. The wizarding world, and the characters in it, aren't all they seem.
Can't wait to return to Hogwarts and watch the rest of the series!",9 April 2021,8,0,
Brilliant!,jake-law123,"Chris Columbus creates this fantasy filled adaptation of the famous J.K. Rowling novel, with excellent visuals, great casting, and the most epic moments you've ever seen. Without a doubt one of the most popular movies of 2001, and is the beginning of one of the most popular series of the decade.
11-year-old Harry Potter, whose lived his life with his dreadful step parents, the Dursleys, gets a visit from a giant man named Hagrid, (Robbie Coltrane) and realizes that he and his ancestors, as well as his dead parents, are wizards. He is then accepted at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds himself a better life.
Brilliantly honors the book, as well as adding its own material. The cast is also well known, with Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, and Maggie Smith as the deputy headmistress. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson play the leading roles as the three most famous teen actresses of the decade. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry's best friend, and Emma Watson playing the clever and smart Hermione Granger who is Harry's other best friend.
Fans of the books will especially love this, but will also attract the attention of others. All the actors excellently portray their characters in the book, by both looks, and personality. A lot of phrases in the book are cited in the movie, showing the movie to be a true book adaptation.
The editing jumps from both happy and normal moments, straight into suspenseful and horrific moments in the blink of an eye. The suspension cleverly introduces itself into the subplots. The cinematography is smooth, steady, and isn't dirty or shaky at all, yet still gives off excitement. The music score by John Williams is, as usual, brilliant. Definitely one of his better music scores. The visuals are excellent as well, even though their just simple CGI. But still look pretty impressive.
Although runs a little long, just about every bit thats in their is necessary. Adds in the necessary things from the book, without including too much non-needed footage. Also includes an extended version that runs a few extra minutes.
One of the most creative films iv'e ever seen, and the best Columbus film. With clever and patient filming, stunning visuals, and adapts to the book greatly, it holds out as one of the best films ever, and will soon be a popular series.",30 November 2010,8,,

A magical holiday classic,Jdc102,"First off- I really, really enjoyed this movie. Very much. It had the same feeling of the book(s) but of course it couldn't cover as much as the book could (it would be near impossible to do it). For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.
There aren't a lot of family movies that capture the kind of humor and adventure/drama that this one does. Just for record, I've read all the books, so that might make me a bit biased, but really its a good adaption.
The acting is superb. I honestly think there should be Academy Award nominations for this movie, both in acting and the movie itself.
-Richard Harris, Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are PERFECT!!, they are so good at capturing the essence of their characters, that shouldn't go without a nomination.
-Also, Daniel Radcliffe does a very, very good job as Harry. I liked him in this part because you can tell he wasn't overly acting like some child stars do; instead his shy/quiet nature was exactly like Harry Potter -Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also PERFECT as their roles of Hermione and Ron, respectively. They really have a talent.
-Great Movie.",22 November 2001,6,,

It's a excellent series. then the criticism written by ignorant idiot can be quite clear, are the usual senseless words of those who took up with the moon across. It 'a film that has a great relationship with the occult and magic and has a few meanings and moral lessons suitable for the growth of children. Punta much about these schools for Maghetti really irritating and disturbing. It 'a film for children, with no spectacular worthy of note and I know a lack narrative in the film.

"Kind of nice, but...",Starbuck-13,"... I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.
Well, I have to confess: I have never ever read a book of the Harry Potter series. So this movie was my first contact with the phenomenon Potter.
And though the movie was aptly made and mostly painless to watch, it certainly did not give me an idea of how a story so full of stereotypes and borrowed ideas from traditional fantasy stories could ever develop into such a mass hysteria media spectacle.
Yes, it might be a nice story for children. That's okay. But what do all the adults find in this story??? The characters are so unendurably good and evil that I could not find the key to the ""magic"" behind it.
So well, this is as far as Harry Potter will ever go for me. Certainly did not get interested into reading one of those books. Certainly won't buy ANY of the terrible merchandize available EVERYWHERE. But probably will watch the second movie too, if only to do my girlfriend a favor...",26 November 2001,5,,

The visual effects in this film are impressive. The sound design and creature design looks amazing and I thought this movie should have won an Oscar. The music is really great and just cool as hell. John Williams did an amazing job and I like his style of music, especially the Superman, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jaws, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter and most of all, the Star Wars musical themes.
And to this day, ET and Jurassic Park remains as my favorite Steven Spielberg films of all time because they are both classic. The visuals and the iconic shot of Elliot and ET riding their bicycle up in the air is amazing and fantastic to see. It still blows me away, what movie directed by Steven Spielberg does not blow you away. The iconic theme in Jurassic Park and the dinosaurs in that film look impressive and that film is what lead George Lucas to do the STAR WARS prequel trilogy.

Great start,RCWjr,"I came to these movies totally oblivious to the books. I have not read a page of any of the novels. With that, my critique of these films is purely on the cinema. I had not previously added my thoughts on the whole series to this point, but with the addition of my thoughts on Order of the Phoenix, I figure it is time I got caught up.
I absolutely enjoyed this movie. I had heard all the clam-mering about Potter being a film and all the fans being pumped up, but as aforementioned, I had not read them, just know the basic outline. I thought Columbus captured a great sense of wonder and ""magic"" with the film. All of the leads were perfectly cast and Columbus set the stage for the series and no matter your opinion of him, have to give credit where credit is due on those two facts.
My only complaint about the movie was the end, which kind of was a little anti-climatic, all in all though, everything with this film from the costumes, set designs and casting were spot on. But the biggest contributor, as is the case with many film he scores, William's score raises this film from being a really good film, to a great one. John Williams is an absolute genius when it comes to finding the right themes for characters. His music adds the perfect touch to all that is going on.

technically the movie is quite brilliant and the actors seem to fit the roles given to them by ms.rowling. i suppose chris columbus' contribution lies merely in extracting half way decent performances from the child artists.
the movie follows the exact sequence of the book and offers absolutely nothing new. however, this could be a good thing for those who havent read the book. in all, i think if you havent read the book, you will enjoy the movie, but if you have, you would probably end up bored like i was. nothing new here.

GOOD FUN!!

So I am in fine position to evaluate the movie on its own merits without any invidious comparisons to published books and the events therein.
Having gone to the theater on the recommendation of a friend, I had no idea what to expect, or whether, as an adult, I would like it, be bored - or be sickened. I was pleasantly surprised.
It has all the elements children love: empowerment especially over adults; secret passageways; cryptic messages and meanings; camaraderie with close friends (especially as a surrogate family); and the occasional monster. But besides all that, I found it to be enjoyable magical fun, and I too got swept up in the adventure, and in the whimsy of such as a secret street for wizards and magicians.
Of course, the school villains are two-dimensional at best, and we've seen their like going back to ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"". This is the weakest element of the script.
I do have to wonder about all the wizardry and witchcraft in a world devoid of God resulting in one way tickets to Hell for all of them. But it hardly matters in such a world of the imagination - a place divorced from reality. And thankfully so.",9 March 2002,7,,

The ginger kid is the only one that can act. In fact, he should of been cast as Harry.
RAdcliffe is so dull, lifeless and mundane. Yet the production company pays him millions. WTF is wrong with the world today? I'm Gald J.K Rowling made a success of her self but the movies sucked.

The Magic is gone.,elcopy,"This is what happens when a good story is done by a non-magical-person. Harry Potter is not a bad movie. The problem
is that is simply competent. It happens that when you tell a
children's story, you just don't only read the lines of the book like a
robot. You act the lines, and give some life to it. What happens with
the storytelling here is that it's lifeless, flat, uninspired. Usually
what we see when making money is the only matter taken in
consideration for creating a movie. Columbus was clearly the
wrong choice for directing the film. Potter has a great story, and
people will enjoy it, though is quite forgettable entertainment. Pity
because it could have been a classic.",17 December 2001,5,,
"A great film, for children and adults alike",MUFCOK,"Right, this review is a review of the film. Not the book. Not how true the film is to the book. Just a review, of the film. I have read the book but it was a very long time ago and I have seen this movie so many times I have forgotten what was in the book and what wasn't. This movie, for me, is fantastic. Let me start by saying that this film, or any of the Harry Potter films, is not a children's film. Of course they appeal to children and are marketed as such but they are certainly appreciated & enjoyed by adults.
The story is well known and probably doesn't need overviewing again but I will do so anyway! As a toddler, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of his Aunties & Uncles by Dumbledore. The story then skips forward 9 years or so and Harry is being treated as a Slave almost, an outcast by his family. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is bullied by his cousin & waits on his Auntie & Uncle hand and foot. As Harry nears his 11th Birthday, post with Harrys name on it starts arriving day after day until one day it arrives in its thousands. Scared by this his Auntie & Uncle take them away to a secluded cabin for a 'holiday'. Here, Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid meets them & informs Harry that he is a wizard and is to enrol at Hogwarts School. The rest of the story pans out with Harry at School, growing up fast, making friends & even enemies.
This film is pure magic. It transports to viewer to a land which is in every way possible, very believable. The sets, the acting & the effects are all first rate. The Acting in particular (on the most part) is absolutely spot on. Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Robbie Coltrane (Hargrid) & Maggie Smith (McGonagall) are all outstanding. The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) & the late Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) also put in fantastic performances as well. My favourite character has to be Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman. His performance as that character is faultless. My only gripe, is Harry Potter himself, played by Daniel Radcliffe. As far as acting is concerned, he is leagues behind the majority of other main actors. His acting may appear worse than it is as he is alongside some of the greatest British actors at this present time. Finding the lead actor poor should really bring the film down but with its fantastic array of other actors make up for it somewhat.
Harry Potter & The Philosophers Stone is a fantastic film that appeals to all ages. The storyline is fantastic, the pace is just right & the character building is certainly a large aspect of this film and sets it up perfectly for the following movies.
With the run time at just fewer than 2 and half hours it does not, for one second, feel like it is dragging its heels. The whole feature transports you to literally, another world and keeps you lost in it until the credits role. This is not my favourite of the Harry Potter franchise, it isn't even in my top 3 and that speaks volumes about my very high rating.

A Harry Potter Virgin Speaks,basilisksamuk,"By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.
I've always avoided Harry Potter as what little I had heard about the books and movies did not appeal to me. The one thing that I had seen was a sequence from this first film of the Quidditch game and this was enough to put me off for all the intervening years. There are plenty of interesting theories on the origin of witches and broomsticks but kids using broomsticks to play a ball game is not one of them. This sequence was still the one I really, really disliked in the film and I groaned every time Quidditch sequences appeared in subsequent films.
Two things surprised me about this film (and was borne out by the subsequent ones). Firstly they aren't about magic and witchcraft at all. In fact the nearest anyone ever gets to magic is waving a wand a speaking a couple of cod Latin words. Secondly they are primarily about life in a boarding school and perhaps should have been called ""Harry of the Second Remove and his Magic Wand"" or perhaps ""Hermione of the Sixth and her  "" (On second thoughts let's not go there).
None of these comments mean that I did not like the film nor that I thought it was bad. On the contrary, once I got past my preconceptions, I thoroughly enjoyed this excellent family film. It worked brilliantly on the level of Harry's ill treatment at the hands of his adoptive parents, his integration into the school and the beginning of the introduction of the external threats to his world. It was well directed, funny and always engaging.
The young cast did well although they clearly had a long way to go. Daniel Radcliffe sometimes looked as though he had been well tutored in the art of pulling particular faces to express different emotions though his eyes didn't always show he had internalised them. Rupert Grint was probably the best of the young actors. The adult actors were uniformly good and the decision to work only with British thesps was clearly the right one.",1 February 2013,7,,
Classic!,barbagvido,"The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure.",31 August 2015,7,,
Fun and Frighteneing,DanB-4,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful film. Loking back, Chris Columbus, the great pop film maker, deserved an Oscar nomination for this film. THere are no wrong choices, showing the world of Hogwarts from Harry's eyes, letting us discover this strange and scary world with him.
It is by no means violent and is as scary as it needs to be. Most children will be able to handle this film and sleep soundly the same night.
What I love about the movie, more than the CGI and special effects, is the building of the relationshio with Ron, Hermoine and Harry. Really, they are three outcast nerds and in spite of Harry's celebrity and power and new found wealth, he chooses them for friends forsaking the likes of the other rich kids. It is a subtle but very strong positive message for kids.
In spite of its running length it can easily hold a child's attention, jumping from trolls to dragons to goblins to quiddich matches, mixing it all in with moments of trues pathos as Harry discovers the truth about his family. Daniel Radcliffe succeeds in portraying Harry as a likable, flawed, emerging hero, fascinated with his own power, but keeping everything in check. (one of the great achievements of this film is how well it is cast, considering the huge number of speaking roles).
Aside from a little uneven acting from the young newcomers in the cast, this film does not strike a wrong note. ***1/2 out of ****.",30 December 2005,8,,
It's the Wonderful of Harry Potter...,janyeap,,15 November 2001,0,,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,haydenluz,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, directed by Chris Columbus, was a wonderful, wizardly time! Knowing Chris Columbus from Home Alone, I was a little skeptical going into this film, but he put his intuitive style all over it, shooting a real dazzling looking film.
The overall concept of the film is outrageously original, filled with tremendous potential and heart, with many memorable scenes! The premise of the film is where the issues come in. The premise is fine, and good kickstart for this favorable series, but it wasn't focused, or fleshed out nearly enough; All the creative team cared about was setting up all this exposition. The exposition is fine to a certain extent, but when seventy percent of the film is exposition, with another fifteen percent being some fan service-filler scenes, it makes it hard to get invested into what's going on, at this point in time. If the creative team cut out most of their filler scenes, they could've tightened up the narrative more, while giving the film an easier run time to digest. The film had a pretty decent pace for more than sixty percent of the film, but the middle act became more of a slowburn pace, creating a few unnecessary plots, that just got left to hang and dry.
I give so much credit to these casting directors, for casting this star-studded cast! With this film being filled with a lot of characters, the creative team did a good job of balancing everyone, crafting countless memorable character moments, while giving them some nice layers to start to develop. It's no secret to say that the three main wizards in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, are the selling point to this film! Almost automatically, they're given phenomenal chemistry, and banter to play around with. They have this pure motivation, that make them really investable, and easy to root for. Although some of the supporting characters can go underdeveloped, they were still a huge asset to the film, and they all came to play ball!
The screenplay by Steve Kloves was pretty well written overall, besides some of the parts and characters that went underdeveloped. He adapted this nice mythical speech style, that worked really well with the setting and plot! The comedy was really well balanced, and interwoven into this, sometimes darker toned film. Steve Kloves worked really well with J.K. Rowling to craft this script, and they made more than a handful of memorable quotes, that will just stick aroun with you forever!
The creative team created tremendous potential with a new world, that opens doors to endless opportunities! The production design looks absolutely beautiful! The creative team utilized so many great set pieces, while having so many great practical costumes and makeup to go along with this amazing world.
It's understandable that the magic isn't all there yet, but I would've liked a little more, with some conflict, to give the film more risks. Columbus had the perfect opportunity to add a lot of stakes, because of the kids inexperience, but the creative team didn't quite jump on it. One of the bigger issues of the film, is the effects. They weren't terrible at the time, but they don't hold up that well, and the creative team carried themselves like they created seamless work.
The score is one of the biggest success this film has. John Williams is a master composer, and he easily crafted one of the most known scores in cinema! The score adds so much depth and intensity to every scene that it's in!
Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always have a special place in my heart, but it has room for improvement.",18 August 2020,7,,

I don't know how this film could have pulled in as much money and critical acclaim as it did. Maybe it was witchcraft then but it didn't get me to waste my money on going to see it at the theater or rent it on video.

The first great of many greats...,SeminolePhenom,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley AKA the Dursleys. His parents were both killed in a car crash when he was very young and he has always been quite strange ever since. Lately, he has been feeling a little stranger than usual. His cousin Dudley has been attacked by a snake when Harry wanted to hurt him and mysterious letters for Harry have been showing up that The Dursleys have UN-mistakenly been trying to hide form him. Harry soon finds out the reason for all of these incidents: He is a wizard. Not only that, he also finds out that he will be attending Hogwarts (Wizarding school for Wizards and Witches) and that his parents were murdered by the most evil of all wizards, Voldemort, who was mysteriously destroyed by Harry.
On his journey to Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends in Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) along with a rival in Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Harry quickly learns of life in the wizard world and finds himself to be quite the celebrity due to his Quidditch (A popular wizard sport played on brooms) skills and his encounter with Voldemort. The movie also stars Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.
This is the first of seven beloved movies adapted from the books by J.K. Rowling. In general, the book is usually better than the movie, and this is no exception, although it is a wonderful adaptation. The acting of the kids was made the movie incredibly entertaining and the effects were done brilliantly. This comes as no surprise, due to the massive book sales that created such a large budget for the film. But one of the greatest things about this movie is that they didn't go for star actors. Yes, you do have Richard Harris and Alan Rickman but they very well-known. Even the biggest star in the movie John Cleese played the very minor role of Nearly Headless Nick. This was a great opportunity to make another great saga of film and they made a wonderful start by not using big names. Overall, this is a great beginning to what hopes to be incredible chronicles and is a wonderful adaptation of the book.
I recommend this film",14 November 2005,6,,
A Delightful Film,marxsarx,"Harry Potter And the Sorcerer's Stone is a delight. When a strange visitor shows up on Harry Potter's eleventh, birthday, he learns that he is a wizard and that there's a place waiting for him at Hogwarts School of Magic. He soon learns of a world that he didn't know existed and makes friends with other children like him. He also learns that he is a very special young man indeed while displaying kindness and decency all along the way.
This is a delightful film. It' beautifully put together and has magical (no pun intended!) touches throughout. How wonderful it is to see the three main characters come to realize the importance of friendship. I love their innocence and youthful integrity. It is superbly edited and the people who put this movie together knew how to use special effects in a movie without letting them get in the way of the story or characters. Bravo! This movie has a special aura about that not many movies are able to attain. I'd rate it a 91/100. It's a must see for any movie buff.",26 June 2003,9,0,
The one you can't really criticise because it started it all,InaneSwine,"So it's the one that started it all - also known as ""the one you can't really criticise because it started it all"". In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.
But let's face it - who cares? To anyone who's never seen or read Harry Potter before, this is the compulsory stepping stone in what turns out to be a most magnificent journey. So brilliantly crafted by Columbus and of course Rowling, Philosopher's Stone features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer - special mentions going to Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris and, in particular, Alan Rickman as Snape - the role he was born to play. The sets depict almost exactly what any reader has ever imagined, and the kids - well - they're pretty bloody cute.
Philosopher's Stone is not the best - it's just a taste test. What happens next is delicious.",18 February 2016,7,,
A Great Introduction to this Franchise,Doublej20005,"I just loved every second of it. Sure some of the effects are dated, some of the child acting is a bit weak and the film is filled to the brim with cliches story wise, but I still loved this. The world-building is phenomenal, and I love getting to see this world alongside Harry. It makes him a lot more relatable character. Speaking of the characters, this must have the best set of characters. Ron, Hermione, Draco, Hagrid, Dumbledore - it must be illegal to have so many iconic characters in one film. But the clear standout is Alan Rickman's phenomenal take on Snape. His performance is undoubtedly fantastic, but it reaches a whole other level when you know the outcome of his character. The twist is honestly pretty good here - let's just say 8 year old me was very shocked when Quirrell was revealed. Some of the effects are dated, but the action on the whole is really well shot and perfectly captures the whimsy of this world. The production design is immaculate, and I haven't even mentioned the magnificent score from John Williams, which might just be one of my all time favourites. Overall, my love for this film and this franchise will never decrease over time. Looking back on it it probably isn't the most well made franchise of all time, but this franchise is still just a blast to revisit for me, and I would strongly, strongly recommend it.",5 February 2021,9,,
A fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family,SinjinSB,"The Harry Potter story is brought from the books to the big screen. Never having read the books, I have to rely on anecdotal evidence that the movie stayed pretty true to the stories. I first saw the movie with my family, who've all read the books. But my youngest sister, Kelly, is the biggest fan. After the movie she was telling me all the things that were different or left out. I jokingly asked her, ""So, you didn't like the movie?""...to which she replied that it was her favorite movie of all-time. That alone, tells me that the movie succeeded. I enjoyed the movie myself and think it's a fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family. The director, Chris Columbus, did a nice job and the actors, especially the kids, were great. Harry Potter is a feast for the eyes and obviously a lot of thought went into the detail. It's heartwarming for me to see this kind of movie made...Something healthy that kids of all ages can be excited about. As a side note, I am especially happy with the books being so popular. It seems like I hardly talk to a kid who hasn't read the books. That says a lot.

"The first and weakest - but still rather good - ""Harry Potter"" movie.",lostintwinpeaks,"As with the books, the movies seem to get better as they progress, so of the two ""Harry Potter"" movies currently released (the third is shortly forthcoming), this is the weakest.
It suffers mainly from some dodgy acting from child actors, at times weak special effects, and a screenplay trying to cram too much of the book's contents into the movie.
However it's still an above-average attempt with some wonderful set-pieces, magical moments and a fantastic older cast.
In fact one of the best things about the movie is its cast including the late great Richard Harris, the wonderful Maggie Smith, a very Hagrid-like Robbie Coltrane, and a great turn from a genuinely smarmy Alan Rickman who is a superb Snape.

How could they possibly think they could make this into a good movie?,smashattack,"This movie was lacking something. If I think hard enough, I bet I'll remember... Oh, yes, it's lacking exactly what its book counterpart had. Imagination. The book was really good; however, the movie... well, you can see that I gave it a 4. The movie's climax was awful. It was almost as if J. K. Rowling was trying to make this movie into a big mystery rather than an adventure. It was some mystery in the book--but not as much as in the movie. The climax in the book was built solidly on evidence and perfectly fitting pieces. However, the movie had cut-off puzzle pieces that were thrown together in the end and somehow expected to be understood. I would also expect better from John Williams (the guy who composed music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc.). I hate to say it, but this music was awful. There was only one spot in which the music fit into the movie and sounded good, and it was toward the end of the movie. John Williams tried too hard to make it sound ""magical"", I think. The movie follows as closely as it can to the book, but I wouldn't really suggest seeing this in the theater unless you're a true die hard Harry Potter fan.",25 November 2001,4,0,
"Harry Potter was meant for pages, not film.",smashattack,"It is obvious that something has gone terribly wrong. It seems J. K. Rowling is focusing much on the new Harry Potter movies, and I wouldn't doubt it soon if the sixth or seventh movie(s) came out before the book(s).
But I'm not here to talk about the books, I'm here to talk about the movie. To discuss how this movie translated from the book would be unfair, so I'll wipe the book from my memory for now.
First of all, I must say that John Williams was the worst person for scoring the music. Williams has done great things in this area, and has been entirely innovative about his craft. However, the entire soundtrack of this movie is cliche. It sounds like something from a very, VERY old seventies movie. Example: The notes of the orchestra have a ""spiraling up and down"" feeling, giving the impression of something out of an old horror movie. The themes are practically not new. Williams was trying to go for themes, when what it really needed was an ominous feeling. Not this ""magical"" stuff that could be found in old Disney movies. It seems Williams is losing his luster, and I'd have preferred Elfman or possibly even Goldsmith to score this movie.
The first thing one will notice upon watching this movie, other than the bland score, is the tasteless acting. While I can understand most of these people are young, never-before actors, it can be quite annoying. It seems the directors MEANT to put Hermione up to saying things in a cliche, ""I'm-better-than-you,"" tone. Ron is a total whiner, and can't seem to control emotions. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is probably the best of the three in this first movie (luckily, the sequel patches up the acting, so it's obvious the problems arose simply because they're new--and, like I said, understandable).
Some of the acting is great. Dumbledore is obvious a top-notch actor (his performance in Gladiator is a good example of his previous, outstanding talent). Hagrid and his, ""Nope, shouldn't have said that, uh-uh..."" is totally believable, and I find him to be one of the better actors in the movie.
However, probably my favorite actor in the entire movie goes to the person who has only about five lines in the script. Filch. ""God, how I miss the screams."" His character is just creepy, and the actor puts him into such a great tangible experience.
The plot is nice, as its taken from the book (ah, forgive me!). I'd like to say that it loses some of its charm from its adaptation... but I promised I wouldn't go into that.
Anyway, it has a nice villain, believable central plot (although the movie doesn't seem to explain quite as well as the book... seems to be some holes, but oh well, read the book).
Probably the worst thing about this movie is that it manages to use every single cliche imaginable. Harry flies down from his broom, clutching Neville's Remembrall, and a swarm of young children are cheering simply because he caught the little ball while Williams' ""heroic"" music plays. That scene is actually sickening... it reminds me of some ""young children beats up the intelligent, corporate tough man"" movie. Harry says a few words to a snake, then immediately says, ""Can you hear me?"" Ron states heroically (after Harry asks what happens after the white pieces move their pawn), ""Then... we play."" Once again, Williams' music only serves to heighten the corniness. It's annoying.
All in all, the movie was an annoyance. Simply geared for younger kids, which cause older viewers to cringe at the sheer stupidity. Good effects, good plot, good story, and some good characters... but those factors can't make up for the total childishness of the movie.",23 July 2003,4,,

I enjoyed every Harry Potter film, and no matter what complaints or grudges you may have, I think most of us can agree it could have been worse...I am very pleased with the Harry Potter films...with book movies it is hard to please everyone.

The 'Wizard of Oz' of a different generation,TheNabOwnzz,"Much like the film in said title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems to essentially be a nice kind of kiddy escapism flick into the world of magic, but like The Wizard of Oz, it still manages to be surprisingly touchy in a profoundly humanistic kind of way despite its far fetched story.
I grew up with these series, and thought they were the greatest thing i have ever seen at the time. Now that i have grown older and judge all cinematic feats objectively, Sorcerer's Stone might have lost some of its figurative magic, but it is still an impressive and genuinely entertaining film. After having recently been through the torture of seeing the entire Twilight saga series, it is nice to see a film series such as Harry Potter that DOES actually have great writing and for the most part good acting, and manages to be believeable in the setting it provides. Dumbledore, who is the most important character in the film, and his dialogue with Harry in front of the mirror shows us that the film manages to still be relevant to actual family values and issues while subtly lying under its gorgeous magical cover.
Visually the film is stunning due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to give it that authentic look, resulting in many on location shots. The outdoor shot of the first time seeing Hogwharts is simply visual delight in what could have easily been an ugly CGI snoozefest. The great hall ( Which was not on location and actually built for the film ) is also fantastic visual beauty, and the high camera angles show us a great overview of the entire room while this is coupled with John Williams's fantastic score, which uses fantastic chords of joy and happiness in the light hearted scenes while still maintaining that ominous mystery feel in the darker scenes, such as the Unicorn search in the dark forest. Williams's score for this film is definitely one of the greatest in the history of film due to the fact that it captures the adventure, joy, mystery & evil of the film like no other.
Its three main characters Harry, Ron & Hermione, who were ofcourse still very young child actors at the time, are surprisingly genuinely enthusiastic and natural about the happenings in the film, and while they will never be the true star of it, they definitely do not drag the film down. However, there are indeed fantastic acting performances in the film, especially by Alan Rickman ( Snape ) whose subtle slow way of speaking is intimidating in its own right, and Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ), who captures the wise and friendly aspect of his character as only Harris can, with his calm demeanor and naturally fatherly character, which only makes it sadder he passed away before the making of the Prisoner of Azkaban, as a Dumbledore as good as Richard Harris's will never be seen.
The narrative of the film is great, with us slowly beginning to understand more about the plot as it unfolds. It doesn't insult any type of audience with obvious dialogue or flashbacks ( *Cough* Twilight * Cough* ) and instead lets the mystery unfold into logic on its own. All three main characters embody their characters perfectly as each is used to the best of their abilities throughout an event in the story, which will make sure none of them seem irrelevant, and all of them give a clear view of what they are like.
It is a grandiose spectacle of visuals and magic, and while obviously lacking in real depth it is also a genuinely human story about an orphan ( Harry ) who finds friendship and courage through a series of brave events.",22 June 2018,7,,
"Good, But There Are Better Stories",byson5186,"Harry Potter has no doubt, played a role in Pop Culture especially for books and movies. I find it very hard to believe as I'm sure most of you also find it hard to believe that this first movie came out almost 14-years ago. Where has all the time gone? I guess we're done with Harry Potter books since 2007, and Harry Potter movies since 2011. Harry Potter doesn't seem so much a part of Pop Culture anymore. I'd say the movies in Pop Culture now, are Jurassic World, Hunger Games, and Frozen. People remember Harry Potter, but I don't see that much Harry Potter franchise or people talking about it so much anymore. You will occasionally find the Harry Potter films on TV, like ABC Family where they occasionally have Harry Potter marathons.
I think the story about how Harry Potter was written is interesting. Let's think about it, the lady who wrote Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling was poor and living off of welfare. The story she wrote was even rejected numerous times before finally being published. It obviously had been a huge success after hitting the bookshelves and with each new copy. There'd even be countdowns at bookstores right as the new books were coming out, back in the days before we had iPhones and when bookstores were more common. J.K. Rowling has become like the second richest lady in England, only behind the Queen Of England. I'd say that shows a story of success, and not giving up.
Despite all this, while Harry Potter is a good story I'd say it's overrated and there are better stories. I definitely don't think that J.K. Rowling should be the second richest lady in England just for writing a kids book, but Harry Potter has obviously appealed to kids and adults, my aunt has read them. I have to say, there are better written fictional stories where the writer hasn't been as well known or made nearly as much money. I've grown up liking DragonBall Z. I even hear people talking more about DragonBall Z, and wearing DragonBall Z clothes than Harry Potter. I worked at Amazon, and I would often times see DragonBall Z franchise there more so than Harry Potter. That's a good, more action packed story of Good Versus Evil than Harry Potter. It also is a story with lots of varieties of character like Human/Saiyan compared to Muggle/Wizzard. I'd have a lot more fun having a DragonBall Z marathon than Harry Potter marathon.
Japan has come up with other good stories. Like, I used to watch Power Rangers as a kid not knowing the show was using footage from a Japanese show, Zyuranger. It would have been hard to see Zyuranger back then in America. But, years later I have the DVDs, and I can't help but think about how much better Zyuranger is than Power Rangers. Japan also had another TV show come out in 1988 that is probably more remembered in Brazil called Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya, a good TV show. A lot of video game characters originated in Japan, like Zelda and Mario. In terms of writing Super Hero stories, no country beats Japan. No country also beats Japan in making video games.
I also used to read the 39 Clues books which were my favorite books for awhile, and I'd say better than Harry Potter. I wonder if they'll make a movie out of them. But, one movie I feel is WAY UNDERRATED is a movie called Earth To Echo. That is such a happy adventurous movie, while it's not my favorite movie I'd consider it THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. My favorite movie is called Junior High Spy. The main character in that movie, Ricky Lazio is a cooler character than Harry Potter. His sidekick Jack is a much funnier character than Ron. Ricky's love interest, Kylie is less stuck up, and more pleasant than Hermione.
So, what I'm saying is while Harry Potter is a clever and good story it doesn't beat other stories mentioned above where the writers didn't become billionaires. So, Harry Potter is definitely overrated, and I'm saying it because of the movies. I feel like the movies do a great job in portraying Hogwarts, and bringing the Harry Potter characters to life. But, these movies while interesting are long dark 2+ hour movies where I feel like can be slow at times and have lots of Go Pee moments. A lot of the Harry Potter movies don't entertain me that much. They're not like DragonBall Z, where I could flip through scenes in the DVDs, and then want to keep watching. It's still entertaining.
So, while this review might be more of Harry Potter as a whole I'll briefly talk about the movie. I like this movie, as it takes us back to the introduction of Harry Potter/Hogwarts. It brings us back to the excitement of the introduction, and when the characters were younger and had higher voices. Also, when they had the House Cup which seems forgotten in the later books/movies. I also feel like the climax in this movie is like the most exciting climax, well the climax in the 4th is pretty exciting. The chess scene, and finding the right key were exciting scenes. This movie is truly a great fun way to introduce us to the first year at Hogwarts and the Harry Potter excitement.
I'd probably now give the movie a 7 or 8, but since I put a 9 on this movie many years ago, I'll leave it at 9.",2 September 2015,9,,

But it turned out to be pretty enjoyable and exciting, and I feel that maybe the best so far, after watching part II and III, this seems to be a proper complete movie.....
The young stars are pretty neat and cool with their acting knowledge and there is no doubt that their acting would improve with time.... Chris Columbus does a fabulous job behind the cameras and the visual effects in the movie are also stunning.........

One of the Best Book To Movie Adaptions I've Seen.,GuyCC,"I've waited a while to see Harry Potter. I've read the books, loved the world, and admittedly, I've been a little hesitant as I've watched this great series overmarketed to the point where it's almost the next Pokemon.
Fortunately, the movie retains the dignity of the book.
I've seen a lot of mixed reaction to this film. Some absolutely love it. Others think it slow-paced and incredibly dull. I think the enjoyment of this film will be based on if you read the books or not. I do think some of the terminology and ""understoods"" of the character motivations in the movie would be somewhat incomprehensible for someone not initiated with Potter's world. Hopefully, this would prompt the uninitiated to read the books before they blast this movie or see the next one. The source material is very accurate with only minor deviations.
That aside, as someone who HAS read the book, I thought the film was quite simply delightful; a term that I normally don't use in describing a film. It adequately captures the moments that made the book so much fun to read. It captures all the details of the books, from Halloween to Christmas, the the ""Return of the Jedi""-esque (in speed and pacing at least) Quidditch match, and even the moments of Harry's wonder of his new world as well as his feelings of dealing with the truth of the loss of his parents. What moments I feared would be lost in the translation were kept in there. As for the cast themselves, the children playing Harry, Ron and Hermione were very likable and accurate to their book counterparts. The same goes for the adults as well.
True, like any book-based movie, there are changes. The good news is that even if they moved a conversation or act, they normally made reference to it in some way rather than forgetting it. The biggest omission I noticed was the removal of Peeves. Hopefully, he'll make a return in the second film.
Another thing people have criticized about this film is John Williams' score. Yes, it does not have the impact of say Star Wars, E.T., Indiana Jones or Schindler's List, but it does add to the film and not ""overwhelm"" it ""sell the movie"" like a lot of people feel it does. There's no one forcing hands or wallets to go buy the soundtrack. Perhaps people wanted a soundtrack with Jessica Simpson or yet another film with Smashmouth's ""All-Star"" placed in it.
As a fan, I had a good time with this film, and was glad to see that they kept the feel of the book as well as they did. For a ""children's"" (I used the term loosely based off the number of adults who enjoy it as well) film, clocking in around 2 1/2 hours is a pretty long time to ask kids to sit through, but I think older kids will be able to. Plus, there are a few scenes that may be a bit too intense for the little ones, such as dealing with Voldemort and Fluffy.
I recommend this film. It's easily one of the best I've seen for this year. I will, however, give this recommendation: If you don't know Harry Potter, I really suggest reading the book before or directly after seeing this film so you can make comparisons to it. You'll find the two don't change that much from the other, and knowing the source material beforehand, while not mandatory, will certainly help make the experience that much more enjoyable. And if you don't want to read the books, ask someone close by. You'll run across more people who know of it than don't.

I love this film, it's a very captivating story and a gift from the Brits.

Already a classic today,kneiss1,"I love this movie. The whole series will be one of my favorite for all times. There is so much creativity, so much atmosphere, so beautiful music in it - you simply have to love it. My god, if I would have still been a child when this movie was released, I probably would have become the biggest fan, buying action figures and the books. Sadly I am a bit too old for the movie, so the movie can't work to his full capability. But even as an adult, you will be sucked up by the atmosphere. It'll make you remember how it was to be a child.
Only 9 points because the acting of the very young kids wasn't that great. - Which is totally understandable, since they have still been very young in this movie. Also I found it a bit bothering that not everything made sense. That was mainly because some stuff was left out, stuff that is explained in the books. Beside that, I have been a bit bothered by cheesy end and some cheap looking computer effects.",1 October 2010,9,0,
I guess you can't satisfy everyone...,Gambitt,"Reading various viewer comments, it seems like everyone has different complaints about HP the movie. Some people complain that scene X, which was CRUCIAL, shouldn't have been cut. Others say that that same scene X was not relevant and thus rightfully excluded. Some people say it was too watered down and childish. Others say it was too scary and inappropriate for kids. Sheesh!
All in all, I thought it was pretty good. Both my girlfriend, who hadn't read any of the books, and I, who read the first 2, enjoyed it.
The only complaint that I would agree with is that the movie was slightly too long. At a hefty 152 minutes, I overheard several viewers afterwards who said that they fell asleep. Although I never fell asleep, I certainly became tired at moments.
Fortunately, the mid-movie Quidditch match added a much needed jolt of electricity. Although the CGI occasionally was too apparent, all in all the Quidditch scene was exciting and engaging, achieving what Phantom Menace's ho-hum pod race could not.
Acting overall was pretty good. Daniel Radcliffe as HP was adequate, but the real show stealers were Rupert Grint(Ron) as the goofy but loyal sidekick and Emma Watson(Hermione) as the perfectly charming, bookish snob. Even Tom Felton as the despicable Draco did a good job.

"Too literal, decidedly non-magical bore",mgmax,"About halfway through Harry Potter 1, I considered walking out. It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.
That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line. It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard). Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository. Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year. Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.
The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job. He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity. Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather. Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather. Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III. Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing. This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects.",15 December 2001,1,,

Don't get me wrong, the effects were outstanding, the sets amazing and the characters were truly brought to life in their fullest form. Ninety-Nine percent of the scenes brought to life were incredibly accurate and wonderful.
The movie, for what it told of the story of the Sorcerer's Stone was too long. Two and half hours and one Quidditch match? What about Malfoy meeting Harry in Diagon Alley, they just skipped that completely! There were several other scenes either entirely ignored or modified, which I found disappointing. There wasn't a whole lot of development for much of the supporting student case (Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, the rest of the Weasley's). Did they even say Hedwig's name once? If they did I missed it.
I was left with mixed feelings at the end of the movie. I felt what was told was great, but what wasn't told was an injustice to a wonderful story. If you're a purist then I don't recommend this movie, if you enjoy movies go see it - its a great experience in cinema.",20 November 2001,8,,

The Epitome of what a fantasy flick should be...,giancarlorocks,"In 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'; movie magic is not only created but completely reinvented. To many loyal readers of the J.K. Rowling series, this has been an arduous wait as they have anticipated their inner most imaginative thoughts of these immortal characters be projected onto the screen in a manner befitting of Hollywood fashion. Warner Brothers, the Studio that released the film knew that that they had their hands on a very bankable box office franchise from the very beginning. Yet, the only way to success would be to efficiently and creatively relay all the character development, plot and imagination that was conveyed from the books.
Within this 2hr. and 23 minute opus we are treated to a 'buffet' of cinematic magic. The characters are engaging, the visual effects are incredible, the plot is condensed yet direct and the pure joy of this film is inexplicable. In short, you will pardon my colloquialism, but this film is what going to the movies is all about.
Our young protagonist is an 11year old wizard, who after being raised by his neglectful aunt and uncle is finally ready for a stay at the Hogwart's School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. While in attendance at this magical and luxurious school and while under the watchful eye of many; he meets his destiny as he proves his worth at saving the school and himself from an elaborate scheme involving the titular stone.
As unlike many films this past year, this film on the other hand functions on many levels. The first mark at knowing a great family film when seeing one is viewing the complete silence of a theatre filled with children and not even one child 'budge' during this fairly lengthy family film. Secondly, it is clear that the film stays true to the novel and makes no attempt at tainting plot for the sake of running time. Thirdly, the end product is an incredible film that will clearly re-launch the Warner Studio back to the head of the industry.
While reading this review, one may easily wonder why the praise for this film is plentiful. Therefore, allow me to elaborate and conjure up many reasons why this film is indeed a great film. Besides the three prior characteristics given to explain the greatness of the film, there is another more outstanding trait that many may not realize. That trait is found in the casting. Our young Harry Potter is played by the young Daniel Radcliffe, a relative newcomer to the business considering he has only appeared in only one another film, 'The Tailor of Panama'. Potter is played with a mix of brilliance and coyness by Radcliffe, who is absolutely photogenic resulting in an attraction that is sustained for the duration of the film. Potter is a calm, everyday looking child who is played by an actor that certainly seemed to enjoy the part as he is constantly grinning throughout the whole film; even in the transition shots. Furthermore, our filmmaker knew that the secret to holding our attention was not only casting a great Potter, but assembling a great cast of supporting child actors who will befriend our Harry Potter and join him in his quest resulting in much screen time as well. This was found in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. They both respectively play Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and are astonishing as two of Harry's partners in unraveling a great mystery locked away at Hogwarth's.
In addition to our child actors; very respectable, prominent British actors are included in the epic adaptation of the book. Richard Harris stars as Headmaster Albus Dumbeldore, Alan Rickman as the deliciously mysterious Professor Severus Snape and Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagell. They all have well grounded roles that shape this film into an enjoyable and fantastic family adventure. Furthermore, the spirit of the book is captured by Steven Kloves' screenwriting as many moments of the book are brought to screen in a picturesque and larger than life way. Among them, the highlighted scene of the film that shows Potter playing the game of Quidditch. This game is a mix of soccer, rugby and hockey all while being played on a flying broom. Also, the trolls, the goblins and Fluffy; the threeheaded dog will all bring a smle to the experienced readers' eye as the fictitious characters have been personified on screen and thus immortalized.
Yet, what good would all this be without the craftsmanship of a director who knows how to handle child actors. Chris Columbus who is most known for the first two 'Home Alone' films steers this film and presents us with a cinematic experience unlike anything we have ever seen before. While exhibiting a Gothic look that appears to be out of the Tim Burton school of production design, this film instills within its' viewer a sense of awe that is pervasive. The film's dark tone somehow balances itself between the darker themes and its' lighter themes resulting in a flawless mix. This can be seen within the incredible intense climax in which a dual faced character appears resulting in a fierce battle with our hero that leaves a body to metamorphisize into ashes.This scene to some parents was so intense that some deemed it too graphic and left the theatre with their children for the duration of the climax.
If there will be one complaint about the film it will be the climax. Yet, one must respect the film's ambitiousness and audacity at carrying out the book's vision in a manner that pleases the loyal fan while revealing this series of books to a whole new audience. In a nutshell, this film is pure magic. And as the ticket counters at the theatres are clinging away just as you read this; do not be surprised if it breaks the biggest cinematic box office grosser of all time.Sinking that already sunken ship is magic in itself and this film has plenty of it, resulting in repeat business that will surely give justice to the film's many subtle moments creating more discovery than on its' first viewing.

Simply GREAT !!!! :-),poem,"After reading the book, the first question that comes in mind about a movie about it is: what for ? Why should anyone want to watch the movie after reading the book ?
This was my first and foremost question, before I even saw the actual movie. With it I walked watching the actual picture, and it certainly had an answer for it.
Where should I start ? Where stop ?
The cast to Harry Potter is simply unbelievable good, the primus inter pares of strengths of this movie. Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid simply got the right actors, which fit to their roles as perfectly natural as Angelina Jolie to Lara Croft (""Tomb Raider""), or Hugh Jackman to Wolvenrine (""X-Men""). And that in four roles at the same time ! Snape got Alan Rickman (""Galaxy Quest"", ""Dogma"" etc), which looks only like a very bad choice until you've seen him, words are simply not enough to describe his simply genial acting here ! Definitely the best actor of the movie, which had no lack of good actors. The rest of the cast was extremely well chosen, and well acted, too. If at all, Dudley wasn't fat enough, and his role was far more aggressive than in the book, and well I always thought of Draco as being far more charismatic.
The other parts of the movie was just as good. Acting was very good to brilliant, directing etc was good, effects where wonderful: for example, Quidditch matches looked as real as they possibly could, even if I would have liked to see some more uses of slow motion here. A specialist told me that the sorting hat wasn't completely perfect, but I didn't noticed that (except that it was definitely smaller than in the book).
After seeing the movie for the first time, I was a little bit surprised that Daniel Radcliffe get bad comments from some people. I've checked this again when seeing the movie the second time, and I definitely and wholeheartedly disagree. Harry looks a little stunned at the start of the movie, but thats what one would expect - he tries not to get the attention of the Dursleys, plus they don't care about his feelings, and then Hagrid comes and tells him he is a wizard ! Harry's acting is just right at these places, I cannot imagine it done better.
The same goes for anyone commenting bad on either Ron or Hermione. These three are all simply natural ! Just look at real children, they don't have a broader set of expressions either. It is just like it should be.
Other people comment that the movie is just too faithful to the book, and that that is 'boring'. I strongly disagree, I don't want to see a movie about the book where some 'genius' has changed the plot. That would be completely annoying, upset me, and makes no sense. And, for example, do you ever remember a bad comment about a Shakespeare movie because they stick to the original plot ?
The real problem of the movie was time famine. Many funny parts of the book where left out, and many scenes, especially at the start, where simply too short to include the humor of the original book. To really understand and enjoy the movie, one REALLY should have read the book before !
And that was also the answer to my question at the start: this movie is finally incomplete, it cannot replace the reading, but it can give you the pictures you had on the inside while reading it again, and faithfully.
GREAT !!! I've seen it three times now, and I plan to see it again !",4 December 2001,9,,

Excellent,de_niro_2001,"Like many people who had read the book before seeing the film I wasn't disappointed. A lot of the film was better than my visualisations when reading the book and the special effects are incredible. The casting is very good. It's a real shame that Richard Harris died. He was great as Dumbledore. Although Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall sometimes seems like Jean Brodie in a pointy hat (you wonder at what point she's going to say ""Gryffindor are the creme a la creme"") I still wouldn't have cast anyone else in the role. She's spot on. The character of Hagrid could have been written for Robbie Coltrane.Some scenes might be a bit intense for younger children but there's plenty in it to appeal to children of all ages and adults too. It is a fantasy story but there are plenty of things in it kids will identify with. Every school has a precocious poshly named girl like Hermione Grainger and a know-it-all who grasses on his mates like Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter appeals to the universal imagination and touches a nerve with a lot of people. I think it is a bit paranoid to say that it makes children interested in the occult and black magic as it is pure fantasy. I think it is more likely to make kids want to run at the brick pillars between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross Station in the hope that they'll go through the wall and they'll be able to board the Hogwarts Express!",3 January 2005,10,,

not just for kids.,fibreoptic,I have always been very scepticle of Harry Potter and i have never read any of the books. I have ignored other people's (usually adults) recommendations of it and have no kids to use an excuse to see it and being a male adult in his late twenties i thought i would hate this movie! BUT i watched it and was quite bewildered at how much i enjoyed it. Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are of course the best actors in it and the children's acting is ok even though Daniel Radcliffe's acting is unconvincing at times with his words. But i did feel like a kid again while watching it and i can see how easy it could be to get immersed in such a world! Was a little disappointed that Alan Rickman didn't get more scene's as he's always awesome to watch no matter what film he's in. On the whole Harry Potter is for anyone who likes fantasy even though i have to admit it did seem a little too sickly sweet at times. I Like it but it doesn't make me want to read the books though :P 8/10 Oh yeah i watched the second film and Harry and the gang jump to the wrong conclusions about who the culprit is once again! You would have thought they would have learned from this one. DUH!,5 February 2004,8,0,
Nothin But Magic Start to Finish!,MadBadMovieman,"This movie was not only about Magic it was nothin but Magic from the start to the finish. Not just the tricks & treats but the performances were magical too. 3 new Heroes for kids of all ages to root for.
We put off seeing from the premiere just because of the crowds but it was so worth waiting for.
Excellent performances by everyone. Even the surprise Ghost in the main dining hall. A long movie and some scenes you could tell had been rather abruptly ended and jumped into the next. Not poor direction
but a bit choppy editing probably due to sheer length. The movie did not seem that long. A lot of story to tell so anyone who likes Magic, sorcery, Great special effects won't mind the ride. (Like the Broom version of the Star Wars Pod Races) The creature in the locked room was very unusual too.

Over-hyped Kids Flick,kellyadmirer,"I saw ""Potter"" in an open frame of mind. I have not read the books, and know next to nothing about the whole Potter phenomenon. I'm also not particularly into the occult, though that can be interesting, like anything else.
What was not particularly interesting was ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" I found it derivative and unoriginal. Every Halloween cliche and image, from magic wands to flying broomsticks to trolls to centaurs, is dragged out of the closet one more time. The film is fantasy fulfillment for the pre-teen and teen set, and as such has a certain value. As art, though, it falls short.
The acting is the film's greatest weakness. The child stars clearly were picked for their looks and not any particular acting finesse. The child they picked - to the accompaniment of international hype - to star as Potter has all the makings of another Mark Hamill. He no doubt will become a legend among Potter groupies and do the inevitable boatload of sequels, but shows no particular promise outside this particular role. His primary acting talent is to give a big toothy grin whenever his enemies are tormented or he triumphs at something or other (which happens with monotonous regularity). In between triumphs, he generally just looks blank, which is a welcome break from his mugging when everyone sees how wonderful he is.
The most striking thing about the other actors is how their talents are utterly squandered. Most striking is John Cleese, who floats in as a ghost and is given absolutely nothing of interest to say. Perhaps they are setting his character up for the sequels. However, since I'm reviewing this film, not them, why he is present at all is a mystery. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are the only actors that make any impact, though John Hurt is fine in a cameo. This film badly needed strong contributions from the likes of Cleese, Richard Harris and the rest, but the script hamstrings them and instead dwells on the kids. It's too bad, because a film about the adults in this make-believe world would have been an artistic, if not financial, success.
Technically, the film falls flat in a number of areas. Most annoying is the background score, which loudly intrudes at every possible instance. Harry walks down a path - and the music wells. The editing is a horror, as scenes that could have been riveting, such as the chess match toward the end, are butchered. If you are going to base the outcome of the tale on a chess match, at least show a little bit of the game! The film's makers clearly look down on their audience as people either incapable or uninterested in understanding a chess match. Instead, they substitute neutered violence by the chess pieces when they capture each other. There was no drama, just more chances for Harry and his crew to look around blankly yet again and await the inevitable triumph. The end of the film, when Potter's school rivals are emotionally crushed, was unintentionally depressing to this viewer. Can't Potter succeed without his lessers being humiliated? Not in this film.
The affected upper-class British accents make a number of the characters, particularly Harry's friend Hermione, appear unsympathetic and ridiculous at times. Expecting a 13-year-old to play a know-it-all and still remain likeable was way too much of a chore for this particular proto-actress. The entire film has a certain voyeuristic flair to it, dwelling on images of sumptuous banquets and manor halls and the like. There is great possibility for satire here, but the film misses its chances and plays it straight. I'm sure a host of comedians are salivating at the prospect won't waste the opportunity.
A bit of inventiveness might have saved the film, but that is sorely lacking. There is little original about this ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" type of tale. The hyped ball game in the middle of the film makes little sense, as Harry (of course) saves the day by singlehandedly catching a butterfly or something after half his team has been wiped out, thus nullifying the efforts of everyone else involved. Ultimately, the film is a fantasy about exciting times at boarding school, with these ""magical"" students going back to their homes at the end, which makes no sense at all. Harry saves the world, but what really matters is that he shows that his crew is superior to his school competitors. This sort of ""For me to win you must fail"" ending seems in vogue right now, in films like ""Legally Blonde,"" and is far from attractive.
Scenes and motifs are ripped off from much better films, such as ""Time Bandits,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Rollerball"" and ""The Longest Yard."" I recommend any of those films over this one.
So was there anything redeeming about the film? Certainly. The three pre-teens I saw the film with loved it, particularly the four-year-old, who has seen it three times (so far). Hard for something to seem unoriginal when you are that age - which tells you something about the natural audience for this film. Children and undemanding adults will no doubt find the constant stream of tired occult images and colorful characters riveting, but they do not make for high art.
This film, running at about three hours, will be a great babysitter when it comes out on dvd, the ""ET"" of its time. If you have kids, you no doubt will wind up owning it, and if possible should wait until then to have them see it. Otherwise, try to find someone else to take them to see ""Potter"" during its theater run. You'll be doing yourself a huge favor. Five stars out of ten for keeping the kids quiet for that long.",25 November 2001,5,,
Good but some weak characterisation. Needed more humour.,Cylex,"This was a fair attempt but more had gone into the effects than character & humour. The best actors were Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy & Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. They were spot on. Unfortunately my favourite character, Hermione, was not as sympathetic as in the book. Instead I prefered Draco but he didn't get as much screen time as he deserved. The ghosts were under used too & Peeves was absent entirely. Since he and the Weasley twins provide most of the humour there wasn't much to be found. I liked the moving figures in the paintings and the floating candles but again these moments were only fleeting. I didn't like the Quidditch Match but then it wasn't that interesting in the book either. I was relieved the Dursleys were cut short as they are just annoying and hateful. The snake could have been left out though. I'm not too fond of the species so had to close my eyes for a few minutes. There is more fun to be had reading the book. 6/10",14 October 2002,6,0,
Please don't feed the cash cow,RolloTomasi,"There is a classic early 90's Far Side cartoon that shows 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS.' The acronym means ""Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society."" Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon I'd call the 'societal embrace.' Enough people give a product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year, most notably with feature films. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter.
With that, I hereby begin DLHPSSS (Didn't Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Society). The first half hour or so I found interesting. Then I noticed that the film continued to roll, but there was still no sign of an actual story. Poor Harry had no objective. There was no jeopardy. Two hours in, finally, something. There's this magic stone created by the world's most powerful wizard (probably all that's protecting him from mass ridicule over being named Dumbledore). By that time I had ceased to care. I can't remember ever caring less how a film was going to end (or wishing more that one simply would). The ending that did eventually come, frankly, stunk. Not only did it keep going, but they add to the agony by reminding the audience of the useless points contest between the houses. I was actually happy when the Slitherin house won. They even ruined that moment for me.
On the way out, my brother, who I saw this with, made a good analogy. He said the film was like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or some other Disneyland ride where you just travel through and watch various animatronic things jump out at you. There's no real story, it's just a bunch of neat things to look at. ""Harry Potter"" isn't far off from this. The plot is missing for so long that it ends up being a whole lot of nothing.
It's been a long time since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place. I sensed that director Chris Columbus, fearing rejection from the book's untold numbers of adorers, had stayed extraordinarily faithful to its content, making ""Harry"" a cash cow just waiting to be fed. There was no risk involved for the film's creators, who knew its audience came built in. None of this is any fault of Rowling's. I'm sure she's written a fine book (yes, I'm the one who hasn't read it yet.) There's a big difference between cinematic storytelling and the dramatic arc of a novel. A novel can survive on details and character alone for a long time. ""Harry Potter"" tries to survive for too much of its ungodly 2.5-hour length on just following Harry around before finally doing something with him. It's a shame because the character is actually intriguing.
I never bought into the ""Harry Potter"" propaganda, but there I was, buying a ticket anyway. I sensed a hesitation from the ticket seller, actually, when I heard 'Harry Potter' come out of my mouth, like he was giving me one last chance to change my mind (""Dude, are you sure you want to see THAT movie?"") Curiosity got the best of me. I find solace in that there are still a couple of people out there who haven't seen it who can still be saved. Maybe I should have seen it sooner.

This is the most offensive kind of film to me, one that passes itself off as cinema, but is really just assorted eye candy. The effects and sets and cute kid actors are designed to make you feel like you've been entertained when you've really just been gypped.
It's been a long time since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" has been released, so long that I'd forgotten why I avoided seeing it in the first place.

Now it's up for a Golden Laurel award, which is the Producer's Guild of America's year-end pat on the back for 'excellence in producing a motion picture,' which translates as 'best job of making lots of money on a motion picture.' (Why do movie producers need a guild? No one knows. No one wants to ask. But that's for another time.) The award should be replaced by something that looks more like the one they give the winners of the MTV Movie Awards: a gold-encrusted bucket of popcorn. ""Harry Potter"" producer David Heyman should certainly win for creating the 'movie project that moved the most popcorn at cineplexes worldwide.'

"The book is imaginative; the movie is ""abridged""",teejayniles2345,"My wife and I recently viewed this 2001 blockbuster on its just released DVD format and we were both favorably impressed. Its length is ""just right"" but some other factors seemed a bit oddly compressed. For all those who've read the series of books by J.K. Rowling and who are eager for her now overdue next installment, the movie is like an abridgment for the now-defunct ""Reader's Digest Condensed Books."" The set-up of Muggles versus Wizards/Witches/Hogwarts blend of ghosts & supernatural-mythological creatures is highly evocatively rendered; the plot is faithfully gleaned from the original material without the subtlety of the book, especially in regard to the school environment. I felt a bit shortchanged, however, in regard to any real mystery about the Stone itself that serves as Title Object. According to the movie's action-driven plot, the top secret nature of the item is kind of a ""fraud"" since nothing is very well-disguised anyway. Overall, this film is a pleasant Hollywood-version of a well-imagined parallel universe scenario. High ratings for the special effects and engaging musical score. The DVD is a bit too kid-oriented for my taste and I would have enjoyed some sort of ""Making of"" documentary.",5 June 2002,10,,
A surprisingly good version,TheArgentWolf,"When I first heard that there was going to be a film remake of the Philosopher's Stone, I thought ""Oh no, they're going to ruin it."" Because as so many people have said in the past to me, a film version of a book is butchered. However, I went to see the film with high hopes, and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.
Christopher Columbus has managed to capture Harry Potter the way I don't think anyone else would've been able to. The casting was also brilliant, and it's nice to know with hardworking actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, the casting director wasn't wrong.
Most of the storyline was able to be captured, which is good, because I would have been disappointed if important facts were forgotten (As they were in Prisoner of Azkaban, but that's another story.) All in all, whether you've read the book or not, I recommend this film. It's a brilliant piece of movie history.",03-May-05,10,1,
A Magical Beginning,HollisWoods,"Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is the only film I can quote word for word. This movie, this franchise, is so important to me for so many reasons, and I'm going to talk about the first chapter, when the boy who lived started his adventure.
As a stand alone movie, this is actually really good. The pacing is great and the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone is told really well. I've seen this movie my whole life so that twist at the end never phased me. But for a newcomer, the villain reveal really was a cool plot twist. What's done really well is how we are introduced to the magical world through Harry's eyes. We learn the culture & customs of this hidden world, more so than the other movies of the series. We learn about the bank, the school, some creatures, and everyone's favorite magical sport. It's a fun adventure of meddlesome kids with a lot of themes that touch the heart, and I personally could never see anything wrong with it. It's just the perfect movie.
Chris Columbus really knew what he was doing when he helped start one of the biggest franchises of all time. However, I would consider David Heyman the father of the films, as he has been deeply a part of not only the Harry Potter films, but the Fantastic Beast films as well. I appreciate both of their work on the films, but the unsung hero is none other than Stuart Craig, the Production Designer.
Sturt Craig has been around for 10 movies in 20 years. One thing that stands out to me in every film is the attention to detail on every set. That moment when Harry arrives in Diagon Alley, you can't help but react the way Harry does. The Great Hall is massive and beautiful. The Gryffindor Common room feels like home. Every little inch of every set is well designed with tiny details that make us more immersed in the universe, and I really appreciate it.
When you watch a film with music composed by John Williams, the music has this way of being its own character. And we all know Williams is a master of creating iconic theme songs. I've listened to the soundtrack so many times and I can recite every song note for note. Some of my favorite pieces of music of all time are in this soundtrack, and I will forever adore this and every other work of Williams.
This is a cast of British royalty. I really have to acknowledge Alan Rickman and his performance as Severus Snape. I've seen several of his other roles, it's no surprise he was hand chosen. Maggie Smith & Robbie Coltrane were the only people that were meant to play McGonagall & Hagrid. And Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore was a superb choice for the Hogwarts Headmaster.
The Sorcerer's Stone is not just the first chapter of Harry's story, but the first chapter for the Golden Trio. These three kids from three different backgrounds pushed aside their differences and not only became fierce friends, but one unstoppable team. And for the first time in his life, Harry was able to learn what having a family could be like. When Dumbledore says ""it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,"" he was trying to tell Harry that though he yearns to know his parents, the family he needs is right there for him, and this continues to be a theme throughout the series.
Daniel, Rupert, and Emma as Harry, Ron, and Hermione couldn't have been cast better. Their acting gets better as the series goes on, but this first movie only required them to be cute, and they succeeded.
My favorite scene is the final scene of the movie. When Hagrid gives Harry the scrapbook, the admiration Harry has in his eyes is a moment where magic didn't come from a spell. As Dumbledore said right before, Love is the strongest kind of magic. The famous line that follows, ""I'm not going home, not really,"" gets me every time, as the movie ends with an extreme wide shot of the the beautiful Hogwarts castle.
As John Williams' music blares through the credits, I'm always left thinking about how, when I was in my darkest moments, Hogwarts was there when I needed it most. As JK Rowling once said, ""Whether you come back by page or by the big screen, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home."" And no matter what I do, what movies I watch, this is the movie I come back to every year, and that feeling of happiness has never gone away.
Speaking of the devil, JK Rowling created something bigger than herself. 19 Years later, after the first film was released, the fandom is so large and so supportive of each other. No matter what Rowling says, she could never take that away. That's why through all the controversies, I've stood by the series, not for her, but for the boy who slept under the stairs. For the know-it-all who is the brightest witch of her age. For the loyal friend with flaming red hair. And for all the characters that call the wizarding world home. The Art is greater than the artist. And I will always be a part of it.

Euro centricity,crypticcrytic,"So you're tired of all those kids reporting on the disappointment of seeing their imagination violated when transformed on the big screen by techno-geeks. My son refuses to go because he doesn't want to ruin his vision of this modern classic. Good, but since I couldn't get out from under the staircase in Book 1, I really have nothing to lose.
Aside form the technical wizardry - did I see that sorting ceremony hat in ""A Nightmare Before Christmas""? - costumes - I want that cloak of invisibility - score - wait, what score? - this film has its way with the audience incorporating all the escapism we all need. But this is a fantasy that relegates almost anyone who isn't traditional British white bread to minor roles like sports announcer, Centaur or walk on. Dare I ask author J.K. Rowlings or director Chris Columbus to bend towards diversity and give us a picture of even those reality-based British suburbia with a touch of multi-culturalism? Or is that too heavy a dose of reality.
The kids are cute and their parts well acted. The story moves and we find ourselves caring for Harry, Ron and Hermione. Did the casting director really look for an Opie look-alike for Harry's hapless sidekick Ron? Harry's muggle family was a little over the top but the plot-twists were well executed. It was pleasant to see the solid assortment of English performers who even in cameo roles gave solid performances. But are they all Caucasians?
What to watch for? There's a great shot of the inner-works of a lock on the vault holding the sorcerer's stone. The opening scene bridges reality and fantasy very well. The troll trashing the girl's toilet must have been based on memories from secondary education. And Harry's wand selection sequence makes me long for the day that merchants knew their wares.
The night before Harry Potter's opening, Steve Martin appeared on the David Letterman show to hype his new film ""Novocain."" ""We're opening opposite Harry Potter. (audience laughter) We figured that Harry Potter would appeal to a select audienceeveryone!""

Very good start to a series; some people just whine too much,Denver53,"I am more than a little surprised to see critics of Harry Potter grousing about bad chess moves and details from the book being left out. Lighten up. A movie never includes every detail from a book, nor does it get every small matter of opinion (i.e. chess strategy) correct. A movie entertains, and when it comes from a book, it creates a living world that more of less matches the world the reader had imagined. Harry Potter #1 does a very good job of bringing this world to the screen.
I have read all of the books, so I am aware that my mind may have automatically filled in details that someone who had not read the books might be puzzled by. Even so, the movie makes as much sense as a fantasy/fairy tale can, and you have a good time watching it. I won't get into the plot because either you already know, or if you don't, trying to explain it here wouldn't do the movie (or book) justice.
I do agree with one criticism that the movie doesn't allow the viewer learn much about the main characters. The Big Three (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are pretty much thrust into the movie and you learn what you can from their actions more than from any exposition. A fourth character, Neville Longbottom, in particular seems to suddenly appear and disappear and then appear again rather awkwardly. But again, that's OK. This movie was 2.5 hours long; it included as many details as it could. At some point, reality dictated that some things be left out. I have a hunch we'll learn more about these characters in the next movie and beyond.
The Quidditch game was far more exciting than the ridiculously slow and cliched ""pod race"" in Star Wars"" The Phantom Menace. In fact, Harry Potter is a far better movie all around. It certainly opens a new world of imagination. It deserves a 9.",26 November 2001,9,,

I could not however recommend to an adult to run out and spend their 12 dollars on this unless they are bringing a child.

A faithful adaptation,Tyson14,"I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.
This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.
The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.
I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.
Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.
I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.",17 August 2014,7,,
Harry Potter and the sorcecer's stone,dineshaishu,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",21-May-19,7,0,

I don't get it...,jpozenel,"Why all the glowing comments? This is one lame movie. Haven't we seen these types of special effects enough already? The acting was lame. The story was lame. The pace was slow. The scenes overly long and trite. I was bored out of my mind.
I don't really think that most children would honestly like the movie very much except for the fact that it's been hyped so much. They probably have collected all the toys and such that go along with the marketing of this drivel. It looks to me that the overly positive reviews are from those that are a part of the sheep syndrome that is sweeping the nation. Join the flock or be an outcast? Sorry, I'm not so easily led...this is one lame movie.
I feel so bad for Richard Harris. One of his last roles and it had to be this weak character. He's probably had worse rolls, but this certainly is not one to be proud of. Big beards do not make a character wise or strong. Alan Rickman's character was by far the best played one.

...Welcome to magic world,BiiivAL,"The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)
June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""
Just imagine...
""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""
I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.
A short word about the actors.
Harry
What to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part. Hermione
Hermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.
Ron
Ronald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.
I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.
The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic. It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.
Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!

"It's fun, I'll give it that",Laitue_Gonflable,"Having not read the Harry Potter series of books, I'm possibly not the best and most-enlightened person to comment on the film adaptation, but at the same time, I won't be emotionally clouded to adore everything Harry Potter no matter what it's really like, so can provide an objective viewpoint.
So, the film is fun. It has its high points and those high points are very enjoyable, but the low points almost completely make up for them. The fact I would assume is that the fun comes from the imagination of J K Rowling in her books rather than the film-makers, and unlike such great children's book adaptations as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory or even Mary Poppins, the film doesn't seem to add anything enjoyable to the story. It's just fun to see the book come to life on the screen.
Personally I'm not much of a fan of the three main actors. Daniel Radcliffe overacts all his pleasant emotions and underacts all his negative emotions while Emma Watson really needs to cut out the exaggerated head movements. Rupert Grint is a shade better, he has a certain credibility in his performance and should really get more credit. He's a touch above your average child actor.
The biggest fun for me is all the great actor cameos from the likes of John Cleese, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and, of course, Richard Harris as Dumbledore. They are definitely the highlight of an otherwise hammy cast.
Overall the plot is fairly well-driven and the special effects are nicely handled. John Williams' musical score complements the action well and the script, while presumably taken almost straight from the book, is good, but not great.

Although, the movie besides the acting was ok and I'll give the movie 8/10 because I think the acting was worth 2 points.

wondrous adventure but long,Rhino Rover,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a much-anticipated movie and not just for children but for adults. It's a fantasy story that created a world of magic and wonder for children and for adults it brought back something that many of us have lost; our imagination.
For those of you who have never read any of the books and have no idea what this movie is about (what rock have you been under?), this movie is based off the first book that J.K. Rowling wrote, `Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. The story revolves around a young boy that discovers he's a wizard. All throughout his life, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has never been able to explain strange things that happen around him in times of distress. Living with his aunt and uncle, Harry was forced to be nothing more than a servant boy. Although they knew what the cause of these happenings were, they never told Harry and did everything possible to hide his origins. He was never given any kind of attention except when something was needed of him. In fact, his bedroom was the `room under the stairs' and if something strange happened that his aunt or uncle found out about, he would get locked in his room for days or weeks. On his 11th birthday he receives a letter indicating that he's been accepted into Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Magic. Up until this point, Harry had no idea that he was a wizard or that he was the cause of these `strange' happenings. From this moment on, his life changes dramatically as he begins a wonderful journey into the discovery of his abilities and the world of magic.
Harry Potter is distinctly British and the worst thing that could have happened is for Hollywood to get a hold of it and make it through their own eyes. So when J.K. Rowling rejected the idea of Steven Spielberg directing it without having British actors (especially the lead actor), it was the first step to a successful picture. Nothing against Spielberg and I'm a huge fan of his but this movie depends greatly on the atmosphere that it creates. And part of that atmosphere was having an old British feel to it. What really worked well for this movie was that it followed the book very closely. But then again, anything that strayed from it would have caused mass criticism from children around the world. However that has never stopped directors and producers before but in this case, this was a critical factor and they were true to the book.
I was quite surprised to find out that the three lead child actors are unknowns. In fact, none of them have ever acted and considering that this is their first movie, I think they did an admirable job. Radcliffe, who plays Potter, fits the physical description of Harry Potter to a `T' and his acting is not bad. The young lady who plays Hermione Granger (Emma Watson II) plays the `Miss Know-it-all' quite well although at some points she goes over the top a bit but that's something you have to expect from inexperienced actors. Rupert Grint plays Ron Weasley, the goofy, smart mouthed friend of Potter and Granger. I actually found him quite entertaining to watch. With the way the books are written and the success that this movie has had so far, we can all assume that there will be other Harry Potter movies so I'm sure we'll see these three actors again and only see better and better performances as they gain experience.
The rest of the cast is a `who's who' of actors. With seasoned actors like Robbie Coltrane, John Cleese, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, etc. it is near impossible to have poor performances. All of these actors played their parts beautifully and true to the characters developed by Rowling. It also helps that they looked like they really got into their parts and the world they were trying to create. I was especially impressed with Rickman's role as Professor Snape, the dark, brooding teacher of potions. The books description of this character is mysterious, moody and a bit slimy and Rickman pulls that off flawlessly.
The one last element that really made this movie was the computer graphics. This is one movie that really required computers to create this world. Like Star Wars, this movie is in a time and place that is unfamiliar to the audience hence its ability to create reality is imperative.
There is one thing about this movie that I have to mention. It is long. At two and a half hours, this will be a long sit for children so make sure they have gone to the bathroom beforehand. The other thing is that for those adults who have read the books, the movie will feel long. Because the movie follows the book so closely, you know exactly what is going on and how much further the story has to go before the movie comes to an end. I was watching this movie with my sister and brother in-law and their reactions to it were quite different. My sister, who read the book beforehand, while still enjoying it immensely, like I found it rather long. For my brother in-law who's never read the books, found the two and a half hours flash by. So my advice is that for you adults who haven't read the book but are thinking about it, watch the movie first before you read the book or else the movie will feel really long. It won't really matter for the children if they've read the books or not; they'll be fascinated by everything they've read about come to life on the see on the screen.
Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was magical and wondrous and definitely suitable for children and adults. In fact the show that I went to was mostly adults. Happy wizarding!",25 November 2001,9,,
An Entertaining Christmas Flick,Akira-36,"I think this was a good adaptation from the original novel and an entertaining movie for Christmas. It must've been a fantastic movie for Potter's fans, since Rowling was very much involved in maintaining originality in the film making. The special effects and casting were good and well polished. The setting and atmosphere were magical too. A highly recommended adventure for the young ones. In terms of target reader/audience, the movie producer and J.K. Rowling have got it right. It was indeed a story that appeals more to the young audience, but rather shallow for mature audiences. I suggest reading The Books of Magic series, courtesy of DC/Vertigo Comics, a brilliant and superior predecessor to Harry Potter, by Neil Gaiman, John Bolton and John Ney Rieber.",16 December 2001,5,0,
"Artistic, haunting, awe-inspiring, and yet so ludicrously criticized",SwingBatta,"This rich adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's bestselling novels, about Harry Potter's adventures during his first year at Hogwarts, gets the budding franchise off to one hell of a start and myself finally into the thick of Pottermania after I watched the DVD and raced through all four books last summer. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) become so immersed in their roles, we have to remind ourselves that we're watching actors. The same goes for all the supporting characters, who are too numerous to mention here, because it's impossible to single out only a select few. There's not one bad performance to be seen. Complementing the players are solid direction by Chris Columbus, incredible sets by Stuart Craig and a powerful soundtrack by John Williams. When you think about it, has the man ever really composed a bad score? HP's only flaws are a long introduction and slow second-half pacing. Were it not for the awesome ""Tomb Raider,"" the boy wizard would have conjured up the best movie of 2001. Yes, you read that right.
The last thing I want to do here is get on my soapbox, but there is one issue regarding this movie that I need to get off my chest. While ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" may not have won any Oscars, it unfortunately does deserve the Complaining About the Color of the Couch Award. (Note the initials.) Never mind that HP earned nearly $1 billion worldwide and is the second-highest grossing film of all time (unfortunately playing second fiddle to the downright horrible ""Titanic""). I don't think I've ever heard so much anally-retentive griping before over one single movie. For instance, considering the universal disdain for tie-in merchandising, Columbus caught holy hell for staunchly rejecting any Harry Potter fast-food tie-ins - at Rowling's request, no less! - while Burger King got away unscathed with their ""Lord of the Rings"" promotion. Go figure.
And to those who just can't enjoy this great work for what it is, and who instead choose to incessantly take apart every little detail, ranging from the acting and direction to the script's excessive - or dearth of - fidelity to the story and other pointless minutiae, try removing your head from your posterior and maybe you'll get a better view of things. These are the same clods who are so full of themselves that some feel the need to list book mistakes on their two-bit websites, as if they believe that doing so will elevate them to a special plateau. While we're on the subject of fidelity, what the hell does ""overfaithfulness"" to the story mean, anyway? 9/10",16 April 2003,9,,

Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane etc. etc. must have sent their agents a Christmas bonus for having secured parts for them in this turkey which demanded of them less engagement than a Roger Moore 007 epic and, even better (!), set them up for numerous sequels until the kids gripped by the books finally add a few years and move onto movies for kids, (and adults!), which, unlike this junk, really DO entertain and amuse, e.g. ""Shrek"", ""Toy Story"", ""Antz"" etc. etc.",26 December 2004,6,0,

Now for the comments: I understood that it is obvious that some scenes might be cut or added on the movie if it's a book. There were several characters, scenes and minor whatsits not included in the film. For example is the Potions scene where Hermione amazingly answer the logic riddle. Peeves, an important character to take part of the mischief of Harry Potter. and who knows what else. I've only seen it once, but I'm pretty sure there are more scenes missing.
But the best part of this film is the actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are brilliant and perfect to fit their parts. They are all adorable and they hold their characters with pride! Same goes with the other characters of the film, (I'm getting tired of typing their names, so sorry!) they are all wonderful!

Based off the acclaimed series by J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus directs the first of the series. Touching, heartfelt and innocent is one way to describe the first of the series, lighthearted in its enjoyment and in its scope, one feels after watching this film that they've barely scraped the surface of the world of magic and muggles and one would be right in making that assessment. John Williams scores the film beautifully and the entire score itself feels like a part of the magic that is this film. The child actors mainly Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do a marvelous job and the chemistry between the three cant be denied by the viewer at at any point. Alan Rickman, who plays the sinister Snape is wonderful in his role and is easily one of the many who do a wonderful job within the film. The late Richard Harris also does a magnificent job as does Maggie Smith. One cant help but be inexplicably drawn to the film, it almost feels as though you are let in on a secret, one in which you are glad to be a part of. While some would argue that the first of the series is perhaps a bit to childish in its nature, i disagree and say it is the most care free of the series, a good introduction piece into a series that only gets darker and more adult as they go.

The casting was perfect, it's like they knew these kids would evolve into the part, the soundtrack from John Williams is top notch, and it's just a fun film to watch. There are some who argue that by following the book so closely the film becomes a bit stale, but I couldn't think of a better way to start the series. By being so faithful to the book, we're able to learn more about the characters and the magical world around them. There are certain parts that could've been fixed but they aren't major and they don't take away from the overall enjoyability of the movie.

Don't Believe the Hype!,ayric,"I have not read the books. I was under the impression that the books were for children, but after noticing that many adults were reading them I had to ask someone. I was told the books were sort of like Star Wars - highly accessible for adults. Well, the film is definitely sort of like Episode I. It is made for kids, and I do not find it particularly accessible for adults.
There are some great effects in this movie, but that is not enough to keep the attention. As the film moves on it becomes uninteresting and quite boring. I am sure most kids will love this, but the filmmakers should have included more intelligence in the fun, like Disney is a prime example of.
The mistakes are plentiful and the story does not take form before 90 minutes have passed. That is when the Sorcerer's Stone is even mentioned for the first time. This is a safe sign that the 152 minutes make an unnecessarily long movie.
The biggest problem of the film is, however, the cast. The complete kid part of the cast (excluding Watson) is completely without charisma. These kids are as uncharming as they come, and I cannot believe how Radcliffe could be chosen to carry a film of these proportions.
One positive thing I have to mention is a very cool chess game with living pieces. Not worth the ticket though.

The First of Many,Snappy207,"Harry Potter and the Someone's Stone is a forming classic, the wizarding world which is portrayed through this movie has so much detail I have watched the full 8 movie series around 10 times at this point (that is not an exaggeration). All the characters are highly memorable and I can not think of another series at which the main actors have grown up at the speed of the characters. And the movies mature as the series progresses too.
I highly recommend you try this series, there are some very cliché moments in this film with poor CGI and it is primarily aimed towards children, start here and watch up to and through the 3rd film and by then you should have got a proper idea if it is for you.

"A wonderful movie, if only you open your eyes",Skeletors_Hood,"""The books are better!"" ""Ruins the book!"" ""Doesn't do the book justice!"" ""A complete waste of time!""
NOT TRUE!!!!
It really burns me the way people will criticize a movie based from a book. It seems that every single time it is done, we as an audience bitch about it, even if we sit around discussing ""wouldn't it be cool if they...."" about our favorite books. And when Hollywood steps up and does just that, we claim to hate it solely because it doesn't fit with our vision of the book.
BIG DEAL!!
Folks, understand two things;
1) when a movie is made from a book, some things have to change as a result, because what works in a book doesn't always happen to work in a film, because...
2) we as a movie watching society can hardly stand to watch anything that it longer than 1hr 45min in a theater....it tries our patience for some reason. And so Hollywood must try to condense subject matter as much as possible, and still tell the same story.
And once in a while, they pull it off, just as they did with Harry Potter. Now, I hadn't read the books when I watched the movie for the first time, and I thought the movie was great! It sparked my interest in the books, and have now read all four of them. The movie did not butcher the book at all...all the major events are there, as well as plot points and characterizations. Alan Rickman was a great Snape, mostly because he does a great job of being creepy. Maggie Smith was also perfect, because she always played great authoritative roles like this one, and the casting for the children in the movie was perfect as well. The scenery was beautiful, and it kept my interest all the way through.
I believe that the complaints listed around this movie are only there because people need something to complain about in any given way, especially about their entertainment. Listed below is a person who quoted the book in the descriptions of the children, and how the actors did not look like how the book describes them. They were actually perfect casting, and after re-reading the book descriptors, there really isn't much difference, so I put that down to nit-picking about details that really weren't that important. Who cares if in the film Hermione doesn't have BIG teeth. Go for the quality of her acting, not the size of her incisors.
If you don't nit-pick it to death, accuse it of being stereotypical, or cry out that it is a bastardization of the book, you'll look at it and see that it really is a good movie. I think that it would have been interesting to see people's reaction to the film if there hadn't been a book about it first.",21 July 2002,10,,

In my opinion, I like this movie because it is a adventure movie, and I like this movie where there is magic and wizard. I am fan of Harry Potter because he is brave to live without his parents.

Wizards: On-screen and behind it too,javaman-7,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2001.
OVERVIEW:
As an infant, Harry Potter (Radcliffe) was deposited on the doorstep of his mean aunt and uncle, and has been living with them and sleeping in a cupboard below the stairs. On his 11th birthday he learns that he's a wizard when he's invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Once he arrives at the paranormal prep school he becomes friends with the clever Hermione (Watson) and the courageous Ron (Grint). He also encounters the hilariously outlandish instructors (Harris, Smith, Rickman and Hart) and the gruff but gentle groundskeeper (Coltrane). While Harry and his friends compete with the other houses on campus, they are also drawn into an adventure involving a mysterious wizard who wants to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. The courage and cleverness of his friends rubs off on Harry and, as the movie ends, his life as a young wizard is... just beginning.
REVIEW: 3 1/2 of 4 Java Mugs
The movie version of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has been long awaited by young readers and their parents, and they won't be disappointed. The screenplay is quite faithful to the book and is fascinating enough to hold any audience's attention despite the 2 1/2 hour length. Episodes are strung together without much transition or explanation but this is a minor fault, since it allows that much more of the story to reach the screen. The dialogue is fast paced and witty, with plenty of high-spirited humor.
Some of the movie's best lines come from Coltrane's character who keeps amazing himself by revealing secrets he is supposed to keep. Radcliffe admirably inhabits Harry's trademark eyeglasses and closely matches the visual image that has emerged from the buzz around book series. As the character closest to ""normal,"" he is our guide into the movie's weird and wonderful world. Watson and Grint are also delightful as his cohorts in conjuring. The witches and wizards who run the arcane academy are played with enormous relish by some of the best British actors at work today, led by Harris, Rickman, Hart and Smith (who, like Jean Brodie, seems forever in her prime).
There are wizards off-screen, too -- those in charge of bringing key episodes to life. Lavish cinematography and imaginative set design capture the central images of the book, including the high-flying Quidditch match (played on turbo-powered broomsticks) and the crucial Wizard's chess match. Computer visuals are combined with actual locations to give the setting a sort of realistic unreality. John Williams' superb score further enlivens many of the key scenes.
And there's more to come. Kloves has already written the screenplay for the second installment and is currently adapting the third novel, while Rowling is about to publish her fifth book in the series.",16 July 2009,9,,
A Magical delight...,stiva,"I saw this movie and I was very much impressed. Chris Columbus had really captured the magic with his amazing creativity. He takes us to a wonderful journey through the magical community. The cast was perfect. The Music was really awesome. The theme song really had the magic in it. Awesome visual effects. The movie was beautifully taken. It had all the elements, the humor, the happiness, the darkness, the sadness and the magic. The movie is as good as the book. My favorite part is the chess under the trapdoor.
A movie definitely worth watching. Trust me, you'll enjoy it. Hats off to Chris Columbus and J.K.Rowling for creating this wonderful magical world.

"The Magic Comes To Life, In A Bit Of A Dull Way",Hellrazr360,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had a lot to live up to as a book-to-film adaptation. For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.
The story of this movie of course revolves around Harry Potter, his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. In this movie Harry just turns eleven and suddenly discovers he's a wizard, and probably the most famous one at that. More details are revealed in the movie about Harry's past but I won't spoil them for those who have yet to experience the books or movies of Potter.
As far as being a loyal translation, Columbus does an excellent job. Yes, plenty from the book is left out of the movie but all the vital moments are in the movie. The moments that did make it to the movie are very loyal to the book, almost too loyal. While I give Columbus credit to making the movie loyal it's just too confined, not just for the young actors in the movie but the impact on the audience as well. It's this that makes Sorcerer's Stone no more than a worthy and passing effort by Columbus.
The young actors that play as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all perfect picks by Columbus, which is definitely a plus. Radcliffe as Potter is a great selection as is Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. But Emma Watson proves as the most creditable selection and as the most mature of the young trio. Surprisingly, the actors and actresses that play the professors do a better job than our three young heroes. Not only are the selections for the professors perfect, but they add a great flair to their roles that make them seem even better for their role.
The presentation of Sorcerer's Stone is magical, no doubt, a great movie for the holidays, but it just isn't enough. The movie is fairly long, at over two hours and for some it will seem as if the film drags on too much. While the translation of the teachers, students and plot of the book is done very nicely it's how everything else is executed where the movie falls apart too. Yes, the final tasks near the end of the movie and the Quidditch match are fun to watch but far from stunning.
The result in Sorcerer's Stone is that it's a good movie through and through, but people, especially fans of the books like myself will feel let down by the movie. Now, this isn't a bad movie, there's lots to love in the film's magical flair from the introduction of the students, teachers and other cast members that make appearances in later films. But, if you're expecting a movie that will dazzle you then you're asking for too much of the movie.",4 February 2006,7,,
Very Good,Niv-1,"The first time I saw this movie I was surprised at the look of the film.
The scenes in the Dursley's neighborhood, look very similar to the way English sitcoms look on public T.V. They are very dry and look almost bleached. The scenes at Hogwarts and Diagon Alley are filled with color, and are visually stunning. Not unlike the Wizard of OZ, which Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone can be easily compared to. The performances are uniformly excellent. The actors in Harry Potter thoroughly establish their characters personalities. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Sean Biggerstaff, and others are really impressive in their roles.
Harry Potter includes some really elaborate art direction and sets. The first scene in Diagon Alley, you see a vibrant, bustling town, it matches the book. Chris Columbus really deserves a lot of credit. His direction artful while being faithful to the book. Without giving to much away the ending was brilliantly re-imagined, it was really fleshed out. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a great and underrated film.",21 October 2002,9,,
I personally loved it!,Darth_Stat,"I loved that shot where you saw him from behind, some of the lovers dialogue was a little corny but the duel shots were great. Christopher Lee looks cool and especially the army shot presumably of clones on the ramp, as well as the one where he is riding the speeder on Tatooine, that was cool as well, as for the bounty hunter shots, it was well worth 13.50. I suppose they added the bonus movie 'Harry Potter and the Cinematographer's Stone' to satisfy the non Star Wars fans, I didn't mind that too much really though.
It seemed no sooner was that old guy Dimpledell and that chick lighting lamps than I was waking up to a train heading away from a huge guy (Beorn from 'The Hobbit' I think he was). I must have been conscious some of the time I suppose though because I remember something about an evil black warrior who turns people to the dark side and seems to have a bit of Phantom of the Opera/and that 'open your mind' guy from Total Recall, complex. I suppose it's a comfort to know that the underground wizard teachers are as ditsy and incompetent favouritists as every-day ones and that the students are as snobby, stuck up and in short cle she-ish as unskilled writers and Disney have always renderred them, and the best news is that Gandalf found a place to settle down and share his knowledge, also as a part-time Santa Clause. I also remember a part of it where one kid pulls out a cloak, holds it infront of himself discovering that it makes him invisible and another kid says, ""I know what that is! thats an invisible cloak!"" Harry must truly be a unique kid I would think, to walk through a wall to a magicians city, make a wand send books flying, find out he is bill gates' heir (or the equivalent), see a talking hat read his mind and then see a 20ft troll and still be wowing when tiny white butterflies appear out of nowhere.
Rowling does not really have a very fertile imagination. Harry Potter is an uninspiring two step equasion. Nobody could really believe that kids would remember any of the 'love' messages or care about them, what they remember is how to cast spells, use a wand, respond to authority, respond to danger, and respond to warning. Harry Potter has no sense of narrative or entertainment, and certainly none of originality. There are points that you hope it will go somewhere but at the same time you can't see it happening, and your fears are rewarded. 10 year olds minus would like this, I am mystified as to where the trans generationalism is. Studios basically don't care about our opinions, because most blockbusters now days seem to justify thier budget in two weeks or less, after that we can pretend all we like that our opinions matter.
In all I would award an 8/10 I suppose, they have betrayed just enough to us but not too much about Episode II. See that trailer while Harry Potter remains in the cinemas, what I really like is that they perfectly picked thier movies, that trailer has been seen by 2 of the 3 biggest american audiences of 2001.",3 January 2002,4,,
series has a shaky start,claudemercure,"An 11-year-old orphan finds out he is a wizard, and subsequently attends wizarding school, where he learns intriguing facts about his past.
Too many scenes fall flat. From the moment Dumbledore casually walks on-screen, the magical elements are treated in a matter-of-fact manner; director Chris Columbus fails to imbue them with a sense of wonder. There are fake-looking special effects (the backgrounds during the flying scenes), as well as some good ones (the moving staircases). But the worst offender is the generic, intrusively over-active score.
Despite all the flaws, the story carries you along. Columbus tends to encourage overacting, but several of the actors here (especially Maggie Smith) apparently didn't oblige. Alan Rickman is probably the best-cast actor in the movie.",12 June 2013,6,0,

Great adaptation but ordinary film,JBLOSS,Not having read Harry Potter I thought this was a very ordinary movie. It seems to be a combination of so many other films and books - particularly British children's fiction - that there's nothing outstanding or original about it. Probably the best thing about it is the set and the locations that they found - except Kings Cross station of course! The children are a bit stiff in their acting but it was good to see that it hadn't been made into some awful homogenised Hollywood schmaltz. I am sure it'll earn a billion but only because the books have been so successful.Definitely one for avid fans or those yet to reach puberty.,2 December 2001,7,0,
Aged well,sidneyleeberthier,"Sure, the special effects are somewhat dated and the lead trio's performances are still to be improved. Nevertheless it's easy to see how the first movie charmed audiences worldwide with its sense of awe, wonder and joy. With a horrifying villain and complex central mystery, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is an easy film to recommend, with scenes that remain iconic to this day and a simple 'dark vs light' dynamic that works very well.",8 November 2020,8,3,
A pretty good special effects showcase that loses much of the book's verbal charm,steve.schonberger,"I liked the movie, and though it did a pretty good job of presenting a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the book. (Well, not really. Real Cliff's Notes typically include analysis along with the synopsis that students sometimes use to avoid reading the whole book.) For someone who has read the book, the movie is somewhat superfluous, although it is a decent effects showcase. For someone who hasn't read the book, it's a good shortcut to the story, although it misses a lot of the verbal cleverness of the book.
Since most people who are likely to be interested in the movie have already read the book (unless they're parents there with kids who are fans), and the movie doesn't add anything to the book in terms of storytelling, the only fair way to rate it for most viewers is on the basis of the effects. In terms of technical craftsmanship, I thought the effects were very good, but they weren't so hot in terms of artistic creativity. That is, the effects were mostly stuff that we've all seen before, but it was very skillfully done collection of stuff we've seen before.
Compared to the long history of mostly-awful fantasy movies, it's an outstanding movie, near the cream of the crop. But since it was released in a year that also included the first Lord of the Rings movie, it looks pretty weak. But just think how brilliant it would have looked if its main fantasy competitor had been something like the cartoon Lord of the Rings, the Dungeons and Dragons movie or Ator the Fighting Eagle.
(I didn't actually see the D&D movie; I was warned off by critics. But I did see Ator way back when, and then saw it again by mistake when it was re-released with a different title, and even wrote an IMDB review for it.)",20 October 2002,7,,
Worth fighting the hordes of kids to see,zapdude,"All right, I'm in my 30's. Many of my friends think I'm odd for liking the Harry Potter books. But I do, and you can call it a solitary vice if you want.
The movie was not perfect, there were sections that dragged a little, the soundtrack is utterly forgettable, but who cares? It's Harry Potter!
This is the first movie I've seen lately where the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being the story. Even though there was a lot of CG in the movie, it was completely transparent. You believe that they are flying on brooms. The quiddich match looked extremely real.
If certain details are missing, like the ghosts, well, they just didn't have time. The movie runs very long as it is, and still there was very little fat to be trimmed. Poor John Cleese, his character had gobs of humor for him to mine... but it was a time thing.
I would say that everyone could benefit from seeing this movie, and if you haven't read the books you may have an advantage. Instead of worrying about Peeves and other details, you would be able to simple enjoy the story on its own merit.

I heard that Steven Spielberg was approached to direct this film and he wanted Haley Joel Osment to play Harry. Well all I can say to that is I am glad that J.K.

An awful lot was expected of this film and - for the most part - it delivers.,blaircam,"Obviously there was an enormous amount of pressure, expectation, and anticipation for this movie and I, for one, was not too disappointed. Ok, it was not a 10, but at least it was fairly faithful to the book. I think its failure may, in some respects, have been that it was too faithful to the book. A film will never quite be able to match the imaginations of millions of children. My wife critised the acting of the children but it was a children's fantasy movie for goodness sake - chronic overacting was required input. I think that the movie is running at almost exactly the right vote. As my brother remarked, 'not so much a 10 on any one thing but a solid 8 all around'.",3 December 2001,8,0,
A wonderful and enchanting movie but really just for children.,chrisjgray2000,"Harry Potter is a movie that has been read by many children and for many of them seeing the film is giving them the chance to see something that they have an image of because of the book. This doesn't mean that children will hate this film as it's brilliant. The acting is quite good and the whole thing has been made superbly, but what will adults see in the film? They will see a children's film and they will enjoy it as it's enjoyable for anyone, but they won't gloat and shine as much as children and may find that they really only want to see it once. Whatever age you are, this is a great film and will probably become a classic in the Family genre, but there's the fact that it's really just a remake of a book which gives you the feeling that your just watching another film that shows a lot of special effects and not any plot.

HARRY POTTER - A movie for ADULT fantasy not kids...,larrysmile1,"This is very good movie! My adult son and I went to see it on Thanksgiving night. There were no kiddies in the movie, only adults, a sleeping child, and some teenage girls.
This movie is really a fantasy that adults will enjoy. First, the cast is all British and Irish. It is good that American actors were not considered for this film. Because, we ""Yanks"" would not know how to properly act with that British-aire! It's a good thing we speak the same language because it would be difficult to follow along in English subtitles! Wonder how the rest of the world is truly understanding this film with subtitles or voice overs in the local language?
Anyway, you don't have to have read any of the Harry Potter books to enjoy this film. And, maybe that's a good thing. I wasn't interested in a fantasy story of some 11 - 12 year old children to have read any of the books. But, as a movie, it does make for a good story.
I won't bother ""telling"" the story or commenting on some of the tricks of the trade. My only real criticism is that I had difficulty understanding some of the dialog of the young child actors due to their soft spoken diction and my lack of familiarity with certain spoken phrases and styles of British speech. Also, as Yanks, many of us don't meet people sporting these uniquely British surnames. It was only when I saw the cast list on www.IMDB.com that I could understand these characters' last names.
12-year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), his 11-year old friend-girl Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and his friend-boy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint - age not listed in IMDB) are people with magical powers.
They are recruited into the freshman class (6th grade?) at an ""Oxford-style"" University of Wizard Training! Remember, it is the British lifestyle that this book/film depicts. Like Oxford, a school composed of a number of distinct colleges, the Wizard U has four different ""houses"" or colleges where the wizards in training are placed according to some inner wizardry ability. You see this school rivalry by the different colors of scarfs, banners, and neckties the children wear.
In the beginning of the movie, we have a sort of borrowed Cinderella story. Harry Potter, an orphan, is living with his wicked stepparents and wicked cousin until he grows up enough to enter the Hogwart's Wizard School! One wants to smack mean-wicked Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia Dursley (Fiona Shaw) as well as cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) for their meanness to young Harry Potter. Young Melling acts like Augustus Gloop the overeater and ""piggy"" from ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" He gets his ""in the end.""
Veteran performances by 71 year old Irish actor Richard Harris as the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (see what I said about ""British"" names?) and 67 year old Dame Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall were a pleasure to view. This proves that there are good roles for older career seasoned actors/actresses.
55 year old Alan Rickman has great facial expressions and one look from him and you feel you are ""guilty"" of some long lost childhood prank just discovered. Mr. Rickman should have had an expanded role and more speaking lines. 51 year old Robbie Coltrane plays a major role as the Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid.
One will like the Hogwart's schools traditional sports rivalry in the form of a ""cricket"" style match with young wizards flying full speed on enchanted witches brooms! One wanted to laugh when Harry Potter receives a ""gift"" of a Nimbus 2000 Model super-flying broom! Why don't the other kids in this college have one like it? A bit of a sticky wicket, ay?
There are lots of computer-generated graphic interfaces in this film. And, it helps to tell the story. I enjoyed the travel back in time to maybe 18th Century England where Hagrid takes Harry to purchase his special wizard ""school supplies."" Humm, all the characters here are wizards and Harry begins to learn that he is famous and ""expected.""
Later into the film, we have what is reminiscent of the ""quest"" as in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. What kinds of ""powers"" do ruby-red stones have, anyway?
I suppose, that in subsequent films, and as Harry and his friendship group grows a little older, we will find them involved in more ""enchanted adventures."" If the entire cast remains and grows up in this genre, then a little romance between Harry and Hermione is needed. A little innocent hand holding and a few kisses would help the interaction between these two characters. Remember ""The Wonder Years?""
So, if you want to finally see a new movie where you won't second-guess the next scenes, then, see Harry Potter. Forget about reading the books if you have not done so and just enjoy the next six films that may ensue over the next dozen or so years to come. Maybe this will become a Thanksgiving tradition.
Forget all the talk-hype about anti-religion, witches, black magic, etc. This is a NO HARM fantasy movie. The ""Devil"" is not going to invade one's household. Just think about Samantha Stevens from ""Bewitched"" for all those years we watched her on TV and in reruns. This movie is that innocent. Good triumphs over evil. Whether you are a wizard or a mortal!

Way better than Fellowship,ufo0001,"pros: Costumes, score, directing, acting, script, special effects, cast.
Cons: None.
In a time where movies that generate unusually amounts of hype are usually the bad ones, Harry Potter not only exceeded my expectations, it shattered them. I was floored with this movie. Till this day why it didn't win any oscars or at least get nominated for best film I will never know. My only theory is that it was a British Film as the only main individual who was involved in it that wasn't british was Chris Columbus. plus Spielberg must have been hurting by the major diss. Most people I watch it with complain that it is too slow but that is the beauty of this film. It doesn't rush you into the world of Harry Potter but instead usually accompanies you, showing u wonders a little at a time much like the book. Other have said it is too faithful to the book. All I can say to them is that you haven't read the book. trust me folks a lot of stuff was aken out, particularly the beginning. What sets Harry Potter away from other films that year was the script and acting. Anytime I saw Radgliffe, Grinch, and Watson at screen together a smile came to my face.The elder all star cast was even better. For example as Hermoine would say, one of the classic scenes in this movie would be the troll scene. Professor quirell comes running in and shouts ""troll in the dungeon, thought u ought to know"" then he faints. Instead of an immediate reaction, about 2 seconds is given for the thought to reach the students, then they all start screaming, I always laugh at that scene everytime. ALthough lenghty sometimes, it has enough wonders to keep you through. Some of the effects are quite spectacular like Fluffy and the Quidditch match. That has to rate as one of my all time best cinematic moments. Was really excels in this movie is Chris Columbus directing. My God he was great. Perfect balance of action, suspense, mystery and he really helped the kids get their act together so to speak. The score was brilliant. From now on John Williams should be scoring every project in Hollywood rather than that once good-turned hack Elfman.It isn't a mystery why this movie became the second highest grossing movie of all time even thought it had a 21/2 hr running period. I can't seem to stop watching this movie and will probably watch it again right after I am done typing this review. Probably my second all time favourite movie next to Dick Tracy.

Christopher Columbus was the first of numerous directors to take the director's seat and cohesively bring together a film to do justice to Rowling's original novel.
Back in the beginning, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was destined to become the chosen one, the one to bring balance to magic. Living with his cruel and deceitful Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Harry jumps at the chance of leaving home to attend a school of magic with friendly messenger Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). While swiftly making friends in the form of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), he soon realises that villainous beings may be at work in the halls of Hogwarts - the school of magic.
It's all rather exciting - even more so at the time of its release as it was the first 'Harry Potter' movie to be released.
Certainly, not the best of the collection in my eyes anyway. The trio of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are still finding their feet and maximum acting ability - the chemistry is still developing. Also, it feels more of an introductory movie more than anything else but when watching it over again, it brings back the sense of enjoyment and happiness of viewing its evolution once more.
Concluding, I offer seven points to Gryffindor!",21 December 2012,7,,
Magical Start,enigmaticmaniac,Its not at all appropriate to regard it as a movie meant for kids. After watching you will realize that the world of fantasy and magic is totally enjoying. I haven't read book and so I won't be talking in comparison but the movie is a well made start for the series. The direction is good and screenplay is very interesting. It totally feels that we have entered in another world. The younger cast has done really good and are totally characteristic in their role. Its not surprising that you may start believing in magic as the magical experience of the movie is so lively. I must say this is one of the best fantasy concept and its worth watching.,17 July 2011,7,0,
Excellent beginning,eldergod-1,"The movie is really a nice introduction to the magical world of ""Hogwarts"". The actors are really nice, especially Dan Radcliffe as little Harry Potter and the film is similar to the book unlike other fantasy movies, based on famous novels. The effects are good, not stunning, but well made and the movie has some memorable scenes such as the magic chess game.
In conclusion, great beginning to a dare project. I watched it after I have read the first book and liked it more than the novel, even if I am an admirer of J. K. Rowling. But with this movie I saw the world of Harry and the feeling was great. 10/10",8 October 2004,10,0,
"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book",kylopod,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.
Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.
As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.
I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.
But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.
Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.
The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.
Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.
The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.
What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",20 November 2001,7,,
Amazing beginning,D4V1D2411,The CGI feels dated at some scenes and at one point it does feel a little bit too long but its entertaining as hell with a really good feeling of magic. The best way this saga could have started.,20 March 2022,8,0,
Finllay re-watched it,AxProductions,"This film is by all means a classic, but classic does not mean great. Though the set design and camera work (not specifically cinematography but rather how the camera moved through scenes) and editing was great. That film as a whole does not deserve as much credit as it gets.
The acting is awful and, I mean that in the biggest way possible. And the pacing throughout the movie also makes no sense. The introduction of the film feels forced and like a joke, but not in a funny way, and finally the cinematography is plain and average at best.
What makes me give this 5 stars instead of 2 or 3 though, is the outstanding set design and beautiful scenes which where definitely not made great through cinematography.

Brilliant...magical...great entertainment,ksaelagnulraon,"The only regret I have about HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is that I'm not ten years old anymore. Alas, I'm double that age (still young, obviously!!), and only discovered the wonder of Harry Potter, Hogwarts and Quidditch eighteen months ago. Of course, I've since purchased all four novels and two supplementaries (FANTASTIC CREATURES and QUIDDITCH), and have just seen the film, which opened five days ago here. Yes, I suppose we had our own books and films when we were children (including FINDERS KEEPERS, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, BATMAN, THE WITCHES), but nothing which united (nearly) everyone, and appealed to parents and older children as much as HARRY POTTER. The simplicity of the concept is, of course, the key: it's a fairly formulaic plot, with semi-predictable twists (of course, I'm speaking more from an adult point of view here) and the subject matter is something which will continue to fascinate children for generations to come - magic. The film is, in my opinion, the best possible outcome of attempting to adapt the novel: the Quidditch game is spot-on, the child actors are well-cast (even if they do try to overact in places, but one has to expect this), the magic of Hogwarts Castle and Hogwarts Express and the invisibility cloak is definitely there. Some have accused it of dragging in the middle - I must say I was expecting this, being a part-Hollywood production and nearly 150 minutes long, but I never experienced it: I was obviously too preoccupied with the wonder and magic of it all. I couldn't help thinking how I would have reacted to such a film ten years ago: I would have surely been in heaven. The real magic of the story is, of course, Rowling's promotion of ""dorky"" behaviour, which has been victimised in the last fifteen years from Americanised ""satirical"" TV series (THE SIMPSONS, SOUTH PARK, etc...) and general irresponsibility by marketers aiming their products at children. For example, children as young as seven and eight are worrying about ""image"" - boys must have short spikey blonde-tipped hair like the boy-bands, and girls must dress like Brittney: they are being forced to grow up far too quickly, and are exposed to images etc which have detracted from traditional children's stories...until now. Ten-year-olds don't listen to Peter Coombe anymore, because there's no such performer out there: youngsters still have The Wiggles, and Hi-Five is doing its best, but acts like Brittney Spears & Co. have broken into this (very lucrative) age bracket - kids must now act like teenagers, another culture which didn't exist pre-rock'n'roll. But with texts like HARRY POTTER, MONSTERS INC, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, etc..., kids can be kids again: it's becoming accepted once more. Hell, HARRY POTTER promotes reading, playing chess, intelligence, initiative - and glasses (!!), five things which have certainly been ""outlawed"" in the past decade by THE SIMPSONS and SOUTH PARK-style shows. Rating: 9/10.",3 December 2001,9,,
"Will leave more mature audiences unimpressed, especially if they have read the books...",Extraordinary_Machine,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
Quite watchable, but basically a children's film that will leave more mature audiences unimpressed, especially if they have read the novels by J.K. Rowling. The book was exceptionally well-written and this is probably one of the things that draws in the adult reader. The film, on the other hand, whilst a reasonably faithful and engaging adaptation, adds little beyond putting amiable faces to the names of the characters. All very competent and a must see for any 'Potter' fans, but hardly outstanding in its own right.

Good enough for a start,h-62007-26888,"Unfortunately, the books were not my introduction to the franchise. This was. And yet, by watching it, this was possibly the most engrosed I've ever been in a book series.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a solid feature that hits several of the right notes and does so in the most unique way imaginable for a feature. Sure, it may suffer from slow pacing with a long runtime and outdated CGI, but it does make up for it with an engaging and enjoyable story, plenty of heartfelt emotion, exciting action scenes, practical effects that work to the movie's advantage, likable characters, and actors that did work well together to make the movie engaging.
My recommendation is that this is a generally fun movie for anyone who wants an understandable and simple start to the franchise. If you don't want the books, then this is a nice alternative. You can never go wrong with this one.",21 December 2020,8,0,
"A very well done, plot-driven film. Recommended.",db3,"HARRY POTTER ***_ Fantasy / Adventure Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Richard Harris
Harry potter is 10 years old. He has lived with his aunt and uncle since he was 3 -- when his parents were killed by the 'Darth Vader' of the Sorcery world. Harry is disliked and generally mistreated by his step-parents and his spoiled step-brother.
Harry has a natural ability for sorcery, and in one scene makes the glass disappear from the snake cage at the zoo. His brother, who had been beating on the glass to annoy the snake, falls in. No one is hurt. Soon Harry is afforded the opportunity to go to Hogwarts boarding school, where his magical abilities will be fine-tuned.
The rest of the film chronicles Harry's adventures during his first year of school.
HARRY POTTER is very well done. Contrary to the norm in today's big-budget special effects films, this movie is plot-driven. Special effects are used to bring the story to life, not to demonstrate what can be done today with computer animation. The characters are well-cast and believable. In spite of the subject matter being the occult, the overall tone of the film is highly moral. This is a film which can be enjoyed by the whole family.",16 November 2001,8,,

WOW!!! Probably among the worst 50 movies of all time.,AlienByChoice,"I have never read the book this film is supposed to be based on, therefore, I can only judge this movie by itself. And there is not much to judge. I quit after 40 minutes or so and I have no regrets. The acting is ... well, it's not there. The script is a fairy tale, which takes itself way too seriously, making the story as dull and predictable as possible. The camera work is so standard, you can predict the angle of the next shot. What can I say - I just hope the book is better, since many kids like it. I would have given it 3 out of 10, but the wasted budget and the hype take their toll... 1 out of 10.
