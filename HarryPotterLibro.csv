Airborne,Stephen Fry > Jim Dale,Jim Dale's character voices were no where near as good as Stephen Fry's and I immediately went online to find the older audio books.,31,13 de junio de 2021,Estados Unidos,1
kimbacaffeinate,Dale does a wonderful job bringing these characters to life,"t was wonderful revisiting this story. The last time I did a reread was when I bought the illustrated edition and of course, it all started with me looking at the beautiful illustrations and the next thing you know I was lost to this world. Honestly, it never gets old.
Rowling’s writing is marvelous from pacing to her ability to express the character’s emotions. I know there are folks who have not yet read the series (gasps). I, of course, cannot recommend them enough regardless of format. The movies are brilliant, but only scratch the surface of what the books and audios have to offer.

Amazon Customer,Narration leaves you wanting more,"The book, of course, is good. Most people know what they're getting into when they start their journey into the World of Witchcraft & Wizardry. That being said, the narration is less than admirable.
There's very little emotion and fluctuation in his voice. ""Dursleys!"", Hagrid said in a BOOM. A BOOM, not a monotone drawl that sounds like a boy whispering so they don't wake someone nearby.
I'm satisfied with the speed of the narration. Enunciation is good, but there are several instances that leave me wanting more.",2,28 de marzo de 2018,Estados Unidos,3

J. Howie,KindleEbook and Audible versions do not sync.,"I of course love the books themselves, but I just spent a lot of money and don't feel I got what I paid for. The audible doesn't sync up with the Kindle ebook as most others do. My kids read the Kindle version while the audible version plays and it helps with their reading skills. With the price of these versions I would expect that to be a feature. Every other children's book I have purchased has that capability. I called and asked and the people at Amazon weren't very clear on when if ever this feature would be added. Strange. If your kids like to do as mine and read along with the narrator then this version isn't for you. Also I agree with some other reviewers. I wish we had the option of buying the English version. It sounds as if it would have been better.",4,19 de enero de 2016,Estados Unidos,2

MicasReads,The beginning of an amazing story,"Harry Potter was left on his aunt's doorstep when he was a baby and was treated poorly but never understood why. Fast forward to Harry's 11th birthday and he begins to receive odd-looking letters that his uncle gets rid of. When he takes the family away to get away from the onslaught of letters, they are surprised when a giant named Hagrid comes knocking. Hagrid introduces Harry to his true home - Hogwarts. While at Hogwarts Harry learns the story behind his parents' untimely death as well as the scar on his forehead. Harry also comes face to face with the man who tried to kill him - Lord Voldemort. This becomes the first of many encounters between Harry and his sworn enemy.
I have read this book many times but this was my first time listening to a narrator tell the story and I found it very enjoyable. Any adventure into Hogwarts is worth it to me. I know that there are many issues with supporting J.K. Rowling due to her transphobic post but please note this audiobook was borrowed from the library and not purchased so as not to add to her wealth.",,2 de marzo de 2022,Estados Unidos,4

Cory E.,For all ages...,"As I am in my late 40's, I seriously didn't think I was going to like reading the HP series. I initially thought I was too old for the series and that it wouldn't interest me in the slightest. Boy, was I wrong! The HP series is one of the best series I've ever read in my life. I'd put it right up there with James Herriott's All Creatures series, Frank Hebert's Dune series, Jan Karon's Mitford series, or George R.R. Martin's GOT series. YES, I'm aware that the series I just rattled off are all distinctly different, but that's kind of my point... each series has its' own individual style/flavor/flair, but they are ALL enjoyable series for one reason or another and in one way or another.
If you somehow think you're too old to read Harry Potter, I SERIOUSLY urge you to reconsider. I honestly do not think this series has any sort of ""age limit"".",,31 de agosto de 2020,Estados Unidos,5
Alan Montgomery,Wonderful listening,"In some audio books, I find the volume goes in and out. In a car, that doesn't work. Here, Jim Dale does a very good job reading the first book. *I have heard volume 2, also, but it will take a while to get through the whole series.) In some cases Jim Dale's adult male voice doesn't quite reach the characters - Hermione or Petunia. But Vernon sounds remarkably like the movie. His Snape is different than Alan Rickman, but compelling anyhow. His pacing is natural and yet not overly hurried. My quibble is that, in some of the chapters, they could have included the end of the chapter on one cd, but put the ending on the next. This is true from CD1 into CD2, and 2 into CD3. Each CD in the first two volumes holds about 70-74 minutes. I'm enjoying listening a great deal. Although I just purchased the CDs, the covers are the original artwork, not the new ones shown.",,19 de octubre de 2019,Estados Unidos,5

WOW!
The gentleman performing the series ( and he is a trained actor), is nothing less than amazing. Some of his boices are nearly identical to the actors in the movies. When the day is just too hard, and I need a break- this series is what I turn to. It reminds me of my childhood again. Very highly recommended.",,14 de diciembre de 2020,Estados Unidos,5

I have intended upon going through all of the Harry Potter books and am hoping the same narrator is with all of them!

'chelle,"A Magical Tale, Beautifully Narrated","At first I was disappointed to learn that the UK version was read by Stephen Fry, but the US version was by Jim Dale. As much as I love Mr. Fry, I am disappointed no longer. Mr. Dale performs this book so well that I find myself loving the audio even more than the print version.
There's nothing more I can say about Harry Potter. After all, we're talking about possibly the most well known story in the world. It's a magnificent fantasy tale. I wished I'd been able to grow up with it as a generation of fortunate children did. The audio is fabulous.",,7 de diciembre de 2019,Estados Unidos,4
Amazon Customer,A Good But Shallow Story,"What is left to say about this book? Since its initial printing in 1998, with 120 million copies purchased, it has become the greatest selling book of all time. Sparking a franchise that saw heights of popularity never dreamed of by other authors. Even if you have not read a page of the books, you have very likely seen at least one of the movies that was spawned from them, as evidenced by the fact that the eight films themselves made over $7 billion worldwide. All of this served to make Harry Potter creator JK Rowling worth $1 billion.
But what of Sorcerer’s Stone itself? It’s a very straightforward, simple story, about an 11 year old boy getting to go to wizard school and having adventures. Unlike other fantasy writers like JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis and Robert Heinlein, Rowling doesn’t spend too many pages describing Hogwarts or Diagon Alley so the world is not that large. For someone like me who wanted to see some world building, this was a little disappointing. But I am a man in his 30s who likes long books, with complex characters, storylines and conflicts that are often morally ambiguous. Obviously not Rowling’s intended audience.
For a child just starting to develop their imagination, this would be a fun and fairly quick read. Characters, while lacking depth, do serve their purpose by being likeable or unlikeable as Rowling intends and she does manage to wrap a coming-of-age tale into a kind of cat and mouse story, where Harry has to discover who the villain is before it's too late. Now that I have just finished the book, the red herring around the major plot arc seems a little too obvious and only works if you literally know nothing else about the series. The climax also felt a bit rushed, as if Rowling just wanted to be done. But again, for someone just looking for a fun story, the final reveal should be surprising and the ending satisfying.
Overall, this is a very easy book to get into and while I personally wish there was more character depth and more descriptions of the world, I ultimately think the Sorcerer’s Stone is meant to be a prelude for larger things to come, rather than trying to be a truly great standalone story.",,27 de junio de 2021,Estados Unidos,4
isabelita fordham,The Best,"Jim Dale is an excellent reader. The only problem with this reading He did it before the release of the movie and didn't have the voices down. The proceeding books He gets it prefect. He uses the Richard Harris Dumbledore in all the books and his Mcgonagall voice is perfect and well a Snape. I am and old man but enjoyed the books a lot. JK Rowling was worried that she didn't do a good job in the Deathly Hallows. Well it was an excellent final book. I only wish the Movie used her final battle with Voldemort it was much better then the Movie. But I don't think they could have found a better trio of kids to play the parts. Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were amazing. I guess I'm off topic. This audio book is great check it out....",,3 de diciembre de 2019,Estados Unidos,5
Leona,I'm No Longer a Muggle!,"There was a time when I thought that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, and the rest of the series, would be something I’d never want to read, but after deciding that I didn’t want to miss one of the greatest books/series of my generation I picked it up. Since I’m sure this book has been reviewed within an inch of it’s life, I’ll be brief in my thoughts.
After hearing that the movies, I’ve watched them all, are nothing like the books, I didn’t know what to expect with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. Despite the fact that after finishing this, the first book, I realized the movie was a great adaptation. I can’t help but admit that I ended up loving the book more than the movie, something I never banked on.
While debating on how I was going to jump into this series I ran across the audiobooks that Audible practically shoved in my face every time I would visit the site. Listening to that five minute sample of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone sold me, I never had a chance, lol.
The characterization Jim Dale portrayed throughout the audiobook, made Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone pop better than I ever thought the story could. Better than the actors in the movie!
Since I have acquired the next four books in physical form I am still hesitant to read them. Maybe I’ll pick up the audio for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and slowly begin to read the pages while I’m not on the go and have a moment to read.",,3 de abril de 2016,Estados Unidos,5
Bewitched Reader,Wonderful!,"Audiobook Review
The Harry Potter books are my all time favorite read and the books that turned me into a bibliophile. I've seen the movies countless times and read the books several times, but I have never listened to the audio books, until now. I have been very hesitant to listen to any audio books until recently and even still, I was nervous to listen to Harry Potter in audio. I was afraid the audio experience wouldn't be one I enjoyed and wouldn't do the books justice.
I was so happy to find out I was wrong after listening to the Sorcerer's Stone. Jim Dale did an outstanding job with the narration. I was seriously surprised that one person did so many unique and different voices throughout the story. It didn't feel like I was being read to at all, but instead like I was watching a movie and experiencing the story.",,29 de enero de 2019,Estados Unidos,5

Jacqueline,Not a fan of Jim Dale's Narration,"I am revisiting this childhood favorite 14 years from my discovery of the enchanting world of wizards and muggles. J.K Rowling is an astonishing story teller and character mapper. I give this 3 stars for the Audible version, as Jim Dale is a poor narrator. All of his character voices from Harry to goblins to Dumbledore to Malfoy all sound generally the same, the only ""impressive""/passable one being that of Hagrid; his weakness truly lies in female character voices. I'm looking forward to revisiting this series, but not via Dale's narration. I much would have preferred JK's narration.",,4 de mayo de 2020,Estados Unidos,3
bonnie DALE keck,"audible, by Stephen Fry","audible, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Book 1, Narrated by: Stephen Fry NOT jim dale which listened to all the free excerpts by him and no, no, no, all the voices squeaky and pretty much the same, on the other hand Fry is brill as usual, heard on stories.audible.com, and have heard a few of his others including Sherlock Holmes
By: Arthur Conan Doyle, Stephen Fry, would listen to anything even menu by Stephen Fry, Brian Blessing, or Tom Baker. Audible stories nor audible would let me rate, so here I am.
Ridiculous that audible nor audible stories will let me rate.",,1 de mayo de 2020,Estados Unidos,5
Kareem Alazmah,10-Oct,"This book was a journey full of surprises and new explorations in the wizarding world! I had so much fun reading and could not put the book down once I would pick it up. Harry Potter was such a unique and deep character who you truly feel for from start to finish of the book. His aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are so cruel to him and you start to wish that he was somewhere else and when Hagrid comes and picks him up, I felt a sense of relief for him. I was so invested in his past and how unusual it was for him as a baby to survive (he who must not be named) curse with only a scar. When you meet all the characters in the story, you begin to really see them through the perspective of Harry and have a sense of true friendship with Harry and Hermoine, and utter hate for characters like Draco Malfoy and his friends. Then there are the interesting characters like Professor Snape who you really do not know how to feel about because from the outside looking in he seems very mean and grumpy, but later on in the story you find out that he actually saved Harry from Lord Voldemort's curse in a game of Quidditch. Overall, I really enjoyed the story and you can even tell in this review I did as I cannot stop rambling about it and that is why I gave it 5 stars. I can't wait to read the rest of the stories in the series to see what other adventures there are for me to unfold in the life in the wizarding world. Life truly is Magical in Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. 10/10 would recommend.",,23 de octubre de 2019,Estados Unidos,5
C. Minks,So much better than the movie.,"I just finished the audio book, and I was surprised how much better it is than the movie. So many things happened that they cut out for the movie. And the narrator, Jim Dale, does such a great job. He changes his voice for each character, and there is an actual difference. By the time you get about half way through the book you could tell who is speaking without him telling you, it's very nice and adds a lot of depth. I only wish I had waited to see the movies so I wouldn't have preconceived notions about how characters look. I find it hard to not picture the actors, as some of them look quite a bit different from the descriptions in the book. I can't wait to start book 2.",,7 de abril de 2018,Estados Unidos,5
Sharri_1992,The Magical World of Hogwarts Comes to Life With This Audiobook,"I purchased the audiobook of Harry Potter and The Socerer's Stone narrated by Jim Dale about 2 weeks ago. I was able to finish tonight. As I was listening to it I also followed along in my illustrated version of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. It was nice to look at the pictures while listening to the story. It has been a long time since I read this book for the first time. I believe I was in the 3rd grade. I am now 24 and I have to say I am so glad I listened/read it again, especially at a older age. I was able to fully understand the magical world of Hogwarts and the Wizarding World that J.K. Rowling was able to create so beautifully. I love this story so much, and I love it even more after listening to it with this audio book. Jim Dale does a great job of narrating! His enthusiasm for narrating is obvious and he definitely puts a theatrical aspect into his narration, which I enjoyed.
The only negative thing I could say about this is the price of Amazon's audiobooks. I wish that they weren't so expensive. I will have to wait a week before I can purchase Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.",,26 de marzo de 2016,Estados Unidos,5
Michelle Bradshaw,Absolutely FANTASTIC!,"I have been a fan of Harry Potter since it first came out. I have read all the books and watched the movies. I thought I would give Audible a try. I'm so glad I did! My eyes have truly been opened! It was such a fantastic experience! The narrator did an excellent job. I was hanging on to every word as if it was the first time I ever read it. For all you Harry Potter newbies I really suggest you give it a listen. J.K. Rowling knows her craft well. She has weaved an intricate story that will leave you gasping for more at the end of every chapter. I won't spoil anything, but I will say she has created such depth and back story with each character that you will want to know what happens to each of them. Her talent for descriptive words really painted a picture of what Hogwarts really looks like to me. I am super excited to listen to Chamber of Secrets on Audible next!",,26 de julio de 2018,Estados Unidos,5
Holly Lenz,Great book; great series!,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is the terrific book that starts this wonderful series. It’s not perfect, but it’s really great and so much fun to introduce new readers to. My kids love the series.

Walruseen,"Superior, entrancing narrator!","Absolutely love listening to this version of Harry Potter. I read the books when they were first released in the US, watched the movies, and decided to try a different facet of enjoying the HP story. This audiobook encaptures the magicalness of Harry Potter down to the shift in character voices and at times sound effects. The narrator is phenomenal is his steadiness and reading. I would highly recommend this to life-long and new fans of HP alike!",,6 de mayo de 2019,Estados Unidos,5

Tom Cat,Amazing voice work! Superior to Fry!,"All of these Audiobooks with Jim Dale are fantastic. The voices are especially good. I can't imagine a better Dumbledore or Hagrid, not even the actors come close the Dale's delivery. But honestly the best part of this audiobook is that he actually says Voldemort's name correctly! Having listened to every Dale entry in this series AND some Stephen Fry...Dale comes out far better. He really did his homework and put out an excellent audio adaptation. I listen to this series every long car trip, sometimes starting up Book 1 right after 7's ending. It's that good, folks.",2,1 de enero de 2016,Estados Unidos,5
Just Me,Abominable narration....,"Although I'm a Potterhead to the Nth degree, I found this audible version intolerable simply because of the narrator, Jim Dale. His entire cadence is off--terrible timing and worse pronunciation on some pretty important words (""bezoar,"" for example). I heard a sample of Stephen Fry's version, and he is worlds better! Unfortunately, I read somewhere that the Stephen Fry versions are not available in the US due to international copy restrictions or some such.

Mittens,Help,"I know this book is awesome. I want it downloaded on my audible so I can listen to it. All it will let me do is listen to the sample. There is no way for me to purchase the download. I wish that when purchasing a book or download, there was a button one could click other than free sample. It's torturous to read the sample and be left with no book. Then there are all of these instructions on downloading. They don't work. This happens whenever I purchase any book for my kindle or for audible. I just want the book. The free sample is annoying, forgive my rant, but this happens every time I want a new book. I should not have to complain. This is crazy. Put a button that says purchase and download. Free samples are like getting 1/8 of a cookie. The store is closed, but here is your crumb. Okay, I'll stop. Just please fix this. Thanks. Sorry for the long complaint. Just frustrating.",,12 de septiembre de 2017,Estados Unidos,5
Aaron,Emma's Review,"Imagine being 11 again, but this time you don't live with your parents but instead with your prude aunt and uncle. Then picture your world changing completely when a man twice the size of a normal person barges in to tell you that you're a famous wizard. And you're only 11. At that age, it wouldn't be too hard to believe but you still would never expect to find yourself in a completely different world full of witches and wizards, dragons and goblins as well as magic spells and curses. And on top of that, you find out you're famous? That's a lot to stack onto an 11-year-old but it starts the journey to an amazing life among wizards and spells and everything fantastic you can imagine. That's what Harry Potter is all about. I found this book to be exceptional and I enjoyed reading it thoroughly. I had seen all the movies several times but never put in the effort to read the book until now, and I'm glad I did. I found that I had missed out on a big chunk of the story and read all of the important details that producers can't include in movies. It opened up a new point of view for me in the Harry Potter world that I don't regret putting time into. The writing was wonderfully detailed and portrayed a fun and unique image in my mind which leaves me to wonder how J.K. Rowling came up with the idea to write the series in the first place? Not only is the story line so original and fascinating, but it has extreme detail and everything is included for a reason which ties into all the books in the series, not just the one. So it leaves me wondering just how she thought up all the detail and vivid imagery to create an entire seven book series which all books kept the reader intrigued and hungry for more. That takes true talent from a writer.",,28 de octubre de 2016,Estados Unidos,5
Bryan S. Quick,And Jim Dale does an excellent job at the naration for the entire series,"Rowling's classic tale of Harry Potter's journey into the magical world is worthy of being revisited many times.

His portrayal brings a new element to which you will feel right at home and will be enthralled to the point where will continue listening even after arriving at your destination. He is like one of the main characters in the book, to have anyone else read HP would be a disappointment.

Amazon Customer,"Story is fabulous, Narrator is only so so.","I love the Harry Potter Series as a whole I really do. The reason I gave this a 3 star is that Audible didn't use Stephen Fry as the Narrator. I currently have this series in audio book from years ago. And have been waiting for years for Audible to make it available as well, and was so excited that they finally did until I saw and heard that they went with a different narrator. Yes this guy is British, but his story telling is a bit rushed and he just doesn't tell the story as well as Stephen Fry does.

Heather PBJ,Gryffinder and Voldemore? What's up with all the mispronounced words?,"LOVE the Harry Potter books, but Jim Dales does NOT do them justice. His narration of the non-dialogue parts is quite good, but his character voices are not. And the fact that he mispronounces MANY of the words - it's gryffinDOR and VoldemorT - annoys me to no end. I wish Audible offered the Stephen Fry version.",,9 de octubre de 2021,Estados Unidos,3

Wee Shubba @ Wee Shubba's World.,Stephen Fry is just pure genius,"**Originally posted on ""Wee Shubba's World""*
If you haven't heard of Harry Potter then seriously? Where have you been?? Harry Potter has been a massive part of my life since I was a kid. I grew up on these books and the movies. By the time the last book came out I had a kid of my own. Who is now obsessed with Harry Potter himself.
I received the audio book for review a while ago. And I kept putting off listening to it because I struggle at times with audiobooks. However, after being pestered by my 9 year old to listen to it after he was looking through my phone. I decided we would listen to it together. And I regret leaving it so long. The audiobook was quite simply magical.
You all know the story of Harry Potter. The boy wizard. Sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Grew up not knowing who he really was. Then off to Hogwarts where he befriends Ron and Hermonie. And the trio go on magical adventures that could ""get them killed. Or worse Expelled"" (lol. I couldn't resist, and don't lie you totally said that in Hermonies voice)
Harry Potter and the Philosophers stones is where is all starts. You are drawn into this book from the page. I have reread my copy so many times that its falling apart. So by having Stephen Fry as the narrator just makes this perfect. His voice just works perfectly with the story. And he gets right into character. Some audiobook narrators just come across as dull, flat like a robot. Stephen Fry just make this book stand out even more than it already does.
My 9 year old fell in love with the audiobook. He was only a baby when I read him the book so he didn't remember it. So it seeing his reaction to was magical in itself and made me so happy that he was enjoying it. Seeing the pure joy in his face actually made me jealous because you only get to experience that feeling with the a new book once. And I don't think he would have experienced that pure joy reading the book alone. It was all in the story telling of the pure genius that is, Stephen Fry.
I highly recommend the audio book to everyone. Whether you have read the books or not. However, it needs to be the Stephen Fry editions. He just makes them all the more enjoyable and easier to listen to.",,4 de julio de 2016,el Reino Unido,5
